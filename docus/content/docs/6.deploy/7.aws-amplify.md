:hr

Nuxt Content projects can be deployed to AWS Amplify with zero configuration.
The module will automatically detect an AWS Amplify environment and will prepare the necessary configuration for deployment.

All you need to do is to install `sqlite3` package in your project and go to AWS Amplify dashboard and create a new project using git repository.

That's it :tada:

::note
By default module will use SQlite database located at `/tmp` directory. You can override the database configuration by providing your own database configuration.
