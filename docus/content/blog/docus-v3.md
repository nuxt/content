We‚Äôve completely rewritten the [Docus](https://docus.dev) theme. Reviving it with a fresh and modern foundation powered by the Nuxt ecosystem and designed by Nuxt UI to offer the best documentation experience.

The goal was simple: take **the best parts of the Nuxt ecosystem** and deliver a documentation theme that‚Äôs powerful, elegant and easy to maintain.

## **What‚Äôs New in Docus v3?**

### **üì¶ A real** [Nuxt]{.text-primary} **app with just one dependency**

Docus is built on top of [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com) (version 4 compatibility mode is enabled so we're already ready for Nuxt 4). That means your documentation is a full Nuxt application with access to the entire Nuxt features: components, modules, plugins, runtime config, and more.

**But**, **the best part is**... You only need the **docus** package. It bundles all the necessary officials Nuxt modules, so you can start writing documentation in seconds. All you need in your app is a `package.json` file and a `content/` folder with your Markdown in it. Then you‚Äôre good to go.

### **‚ú® Designed by** [Nuxt]{.text-primary} **UI Pro**

Docus v2 is powered by **Nuxt UI Pro**, giving you a beautiful, responsive, and accessible theme out of the box. With **Tailwind CSS v4**, **CSS variables**, and the **Tailwind Variants API**, your docs look great by default but stays fully customizable.

You can tweak colors, update typography or adjust component styles globally or per component with simple updates in your `app.config.ts`.

A UI Pro license is currently required, but we‚Äôre working to make it free for everyone soon. Also, if you're currently building an OSS documentation, you can ask for the OSS license at `ui-pro@nuxt.com` .

### **‚úçÔ∏è Markdown with superpowers (MDC syntax by** [Nuxt]{.text-primary} **Content)**

Writing docs has never been more simple. You're one Markdown folder away from it. Furthermore with Nuxt Content and the MDC syntax, you can embed interactive Vue components in Markdown and use any Nuxt UI components or your own custom ones.

### üñ•Ô∏è [Nuxt]{.text-primary} Studio ready

Docus works perfectly with **Nuxt Studio**, allowing you to manage and edit your docs entirely from the browser. No terminal, no local setup. It‚Äôs the ideal way to collaborate with non-technical contributors or manage docs centrally for your team.

Technical SEO is tricky and boring. Docus offers a solid, opt-in default setup that works out of the box while giving you full control to customize your SEO metadata, from pages metas to social sharing images.

### **üîß Full customization via component overrides**

Need to replace parts of the layout or UI? Docus uses **Nuxt Layers** to let you override core components we've defined. Just create a new component in your project‚Äôs `components/` directory using the same name, and Docus will automatically use it.

### **ü§ñ** LLMs integration by default

Docus integrates `nuxt-llms` by default to prepare your content for Large Language Models (LLMs). All your documentation pages are injected and `/llms.txt` file is automatically generated and pre-rendered.
