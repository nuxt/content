## Browse your medias

All medias located in the `/public` directory are available in the **Media** tab of the Studio interface.

It's an intuitive interface for non technical users to manage their `/public` directory.

Users can easily browse folders, upload new media at any level, and drag and drop media, making medias organization straightforward.

The interface is designed to be intuitive for non-technical users. It can be viewed as a user friendly IDE.
