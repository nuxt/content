## OAuth Providers

Nuxt Studio supports authentication with GitHub, GitLab, and Google OAuth providers.

### Provider Comparison

| Feature                 | GitHub OAuth      | GitLab OAuth      | Google OAuth           |
| ----------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Authentication**      | ✅                 | ✅                 | ✅                      |
| **Git Operations**      | ✅ Direct          | ✅ Direct          | ⚠️ Requires Token      |
| **Access Control**      | OAuth scope       | OAuth scope       | Email whitelist        |
| **Moderator Whitelist** | ✅ Optional        | ✅ Optional        | ⚠️ Required            |
| **Required Tokens**     | None (OAuth only) | None (OAuth only) | GitHub or GitLab Token |

::note
You can use both Google and another Git provider for the same application. Google is usually used for non-technical users who don't want to create a GitHub or GitLab account.
::

### GitHub

To use GitHub as your authentication provider, you need to create a GitHub OAuth application.

::prose-steps{level="4"}
#### Navigate to GitHub Developer Settings

Go to [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers) and click **New OAuth App**

#### Configure the GitHub OAuth Application

Fill in the required fields:

- **Application name**: Your app name
- **Homepage URL**: `https://yourdomain.com`
- **Authorization callback URL**: `https://yourdomain.com`

  :::note
  If you want to try studio locally, add your local url as redirect URI: `http://localhost:3000/__nuxt_studio/auth/github`
  :::

#### Copy Your GitHub Credentials

After creating the OAuth app, you'll receive:

- A **Client ID** (visible immediately)
- A **Client Secret** (click **Generate a new client secret**)

#### Set your GitHub environment Variables

Add the GitHub OAuth credentials to your deployment platform's environment variables or in your `.env` file in local

```bash [.env]
STUDIO_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=<your_github_client_id>
STUDIO_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=<your_github_client_secret>
# Optional: Comma-separated list of authorized email addresses for additional access control
# STUDIO_GITHUB_MODERATORS=admin@example.com,editor@example.com
```
::

### GitLab

To use GitLab as your authentication provider, you need to create a GitLab OAuth application.

::prose-steps{level="4"}
#### Navigate to GitLab Applications

Go to your GitLab [User Settings → Applications](https://gitlab.com/-/user_settings/applications) (or your group/organization settings) and create a **New Application**.

#### Configure the GitLab OAuth Application

Fill in the required fields:

- **Application name**: Your app name
- **Redirect URI**: `https://yourdomain.com/__nuxt_studio/auth/gitlab`
- **Scopes**: Select `api` (required for publication)

  :::note
  If you want to try studio locally, add your local url as redirect URI: `http://localhost:3000/__nuxt_studio/auth/gitlab`
  :::

#### Copy Your GitLab Credentials

After creating the OAuth application, you'll receive:

- An **Application ID** (visible immediately)
- A **Secret** (visible immediately)

#### Set your GitLab environment Variables

Add the GitLab OAuth credentials to your deployment platform's environment variables or in your `.env` file in local

```bash [.env]
STUDIO_GITLAB_APPLICATION_ID=<your_gitlab_application_id>
STUDIO_GITLAB_CLIENT_SECRET=<your_gitlab_secret>
# Optional: Comma-separated list of authorized email addresses for additional access control
# STUDIO_GITLAB_MODERATORS=admin@example.com,editor@example.com
```
::

### Google

To use Google as your authentication provider, you need to create a Google OAuth application.

::prose-steps{level="4"}
#### Navigate to Google Cloud Console

Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and select or create a project, then navigate to **APIs & Services → Credentials**.

#### Create OAuth Application

Click **Create Credentials** and **OAuth client ID** and select **Web application** as the application type.

Fill in the required fields:

- **Name**: Your app name
- **Authorized redirect URIs**: `https://yourdomain.com/__nuxt_studio/auth/google`

  :::note
  If you want to try studio locally, add your local url as redirect URI: `http://localhost:3000/__nuxt_studio/auth/google`
  :::

After creating the OAuth client, you'll receive:

- A **Client ID**
- A **Client Secret**

  :::warning
  Do not forget to save them.
  :::

#### Create a Personal Access Token

  :::tabs
    ::::tabs-item{icon="i-lucide-github" label="GitHub"}
    Create a **Fine-grained GitHub Personal Access Token** for your specific repository on [GitHub Settings → Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new).

    Fill in the required fields:

    - **Token name**: Your app name
    - **Resource owner**: The GitHub organization (or user) the repository belongs to
    - **Repository access**: Select **Only select repositories** and choose your repository
    - **Permissions**: Click **Add permission** and select **Contents** then update access to **Read and write**
    ::::

    ::::tabs-item{icon="i-lucide-gitlab" label="GitLab"}
    Create a GitLab Personal Access Token from **User Settings → Personal access tokens** (or your group/organization settings if applicable) on GitLab.

    Recommended configuration:

    - **Name**: Your app name
    - **Expiration date**: Set according to your security policy (GitLab defaults to 365 days, and non-expiring tokens are not allowed on most instances) :note[See GitLab’s guidance on expiry limits.] (<https://docs.gitlab.com/user/profile/personal_access_tokens/>)
    - **Scopes**: `api` (required for reading/writing repository content)

    Copy the generated token; you won’t be able to see it again.
    ::::
  :::

  :::warning
  Google OAuth is used for authentication only. The Git Personal Access Token (`STUDIO_GITHUB_TOKEN` or `STUDIO_GITLAB_TOKEN`) is required to push changes to your repository.
  :::

#### Set your Google environment Variables

Add the **Google OAuth credentials** and the **Personal Access Token** for your Git provider to your deployment platform's environment variables or in your `.env` file locally. Do not forget to also whitelist users allowed to connect with Google with the `STUDIO_GITHUB_MODERATORS` variable.

  :::tabs
    ::::tabs-item{icon="i-lucide-github" label="GitHub"}
    ```bash [.env.github]
    STUDIO_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<your_google_client_id>
    STUDIO_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<your_google_client_secret>
    STUDIO_GITHUB_TOKEN=<your_github_personal_access_token>
    STUDIO_GOOGLE_MODERATORS=admin@example.com,editor@example.com
    ```
    ::::

    ::::tabs-item{icon="i-lucide-gitlab" label="GitLab"}
    ```bash [.env.gitlab]
    STUDIO_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<your_google_client_id>
    STUDIO_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<your_google_client_secret>
    STUDIO_GITLAB_TOKEN=<your_gitlab_personal_access_token>
    STUDIO_GOOGLE_MODERATORS=admin@example.com,editor@example.com
    ```
    ::::
  :::

  :::warning
  The `STUDIO_GOOGLE_MODERATORS` environment variable is **required** and must contain a comma-separated list of email addresses that are allowed to access the Studio. Only users with these email addresses will be able to authenticate.
  :::
::

::tip
That's it! Once deployed with the appropriate credentials set as environment variables. Studio will be accessible from your production instance. Just login on the `/_studio` (or on the route you've configured) to start editing and publishing content.
::

## Advanced options

### Access Control with Moderators

You can optionally restrict access to Studio by defining a whitelist of authorized users through the `STUDIO_{PROVIDER}_MODERATORS` environment variable. This works with all OAuth providers (GitHub, GitLab, and Google).

::note
Moderators are required for Google OAuth and optional for GitHub or GitLab.
::

```bash [.env]
STUDIO_GITHUB_MODERATORS=admin@example.com,editor@example.com,content-manager@example.com
STUDIO_GITLAB_MODERATORS=admin@example.com,editor@example.com,content-manager@example.com
STUDIO_GOOGLE_MODERATORS=admin@example.com,editor@example.com,content-manager@example.com
```

The moderator list should be a comma-separated list of email addresses. Only users who sign in with accounts matching these email addresses will be granted access to the Studio.

#### Behavior by Provider

- **GitHub & GitLab**: If `STUDIO_{PROVIDER}_MODERATORS` is not set or empty, all users who can authenticate through your OAuth app will have access to Studio. The whitelist is **optional**. The Oauth scope will be used for write access preventing any non allowed user to push changes to your repository.
- **Google OAuth**: The `STUDIO_GOOGLE_MODERATORS` environment variable is **required**. Without it, no one will be able to access Studio when using Google OAuth.

### Custom Redirect URL

By default, Studio uses your deployment URL as the OAuth redirect URL. If you need to customize it you can specify a custom redirect URL:

```bash [.env]
# Using GitHub provider
STUDIO_GITHUB_REDIRECT_URL=https://custom-domain.com/__nuxt_studio/auth/github

# Using GitLab provider
STUDIO_GITLAB_REDIRECT_URL=https://custom-domain.com/__nuxt_studio/auth/gitlab

# Using Google provider
STUDIO_GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URL=https://custom-domain.com/__nuxt_studio/auth/google
```

::note
This is useful when you need to handle OAuth callbacks through a specific endpoint.
::

## Working with Staging/Preview Branches

By default, Studio commits changes to the branch specified in your configuration (typically `main`). However, you can configure Studio to work with a staging or preview branch instead.

This is useful when you want to review changes on a preview environment before merging to production. You can currently handle pull requests manually from GitHub, but automatic PR creation is included in our roadmap and will be implemented in a future release.

::prose-steps
### Configure

Update your `nuxt.config.ts` to target your staging branch.

  :::tip
  You can use environment variables to manage multiple branches for different environments.
  :::

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  studio: {
    repository: {
      owner: 'your-username',
      repo: 'your-repo',
      branch: PROCESS.ENV.STUDIO_BRANCH_NAME, // Target your staging branch instead of main
    }
  }
})
```

### Deploy

Configure your hosting platform to deploy the staging branch to a preview URL (e.g., `staging.yourdomain.com`).

### Create a Separate OAuth App (based on your Git provider)

Create a new OAuth App specifically for your staging environment and use your staging URL as callback URL.

### Set Environment Variables

Configure your staging deployment env varibales with the staging OAuth credentials.

```bash [.env.staging]
STUDIO_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=<your_staging_github_client_id>
STUDIO_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=<your_staging_github_client_secret>
STUDIO_GITHUB_BRANCH_NAME=<your_staging_branch_name>
```

### Access Studio on Staging

Navigate to `https://staging.yourdomain.com/_studio` to edit content. All commits will be pushed to your configured staging branch.

### Merging to Production

Once you're satisfied with changes on your staging branch, create a pull request from your staging branch to your main branch on GitHub to deploy to production.

  :::note
  **Pull Request Automation Coming Soon**

  :br

  Automatic pull request creation from Studio is planned for a future release. For now, you'll need to manually create PRs on GitHub to merge staging changes into your main branch.
