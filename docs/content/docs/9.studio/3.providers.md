::prose-note
After initial OAuth setup, synchronization happens automatically and requires no manual action.

## OAuth Providers

Nuxt Studio supports authentication with both GitHub and GitLab OAuth providers.

### GitHub OAuth App

To use GitHub as your Git provider, you need to create a GitHub OAuth application.

::prose-steps{level="4"}
#### Navigate to GitHub Developer Settings

Go to [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers) and click **New OAuth App**

#### Configure the OAuth Application

Fill in the required fields:

- **Application name**: Your app name
- **Homepage URL**: `https://yourdomain.com`
- **Authorization callback URL**: `https://yourdomain.com`:note [If you want to try studio locally, set the callback url to your local url `http://localhost:3000`]

#### Copy Your Credentials

After creating the OAuth app, you'll receive:

- A **Client ID** (visible immediately)
- A **Client Secret** (click **Generate a new client secret**)

#### Set your environment Variables

Add the GitHub OAuth credentials to your deployment platform's environment variables or in your `.env` file in local

```bash [.env]
STUDIO_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=<your_github_client_id>
STUDIO_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=<your_github_client_secret>
```
::

### GitLab OAuth App

To use GitLab as your Git provider, you need to create a GitLab OAuth application.

::prose-steps{level="4"}
#### Navigate to GitLab Applications

Go to your GitLab [User Settings → Applications](https://gitlab.com/-/user_settings/applications) (or your group/organization settings) and create a **New Application**.

#### Configure the OAuth Application

Fill in the required fields:

- **Application name**: Your app name
- **Redirect URI**: `https://yourdomain.com/__nuxt_studio/auth/gitlab`
- **Scopes**: Select `api` (required for publication) :note[If you want to try studio locally, add your local url as redirect URI: `http://localhost:3000/__nuxt_studio/auth/gitlab`]

#### Copy Your Credentials

After creating the OAuth application, you'll receive:

- An **Application ID** (visible immediately)
- A **Secret** (visible immediately)

#### Set your environment Variables

Add the GitLab OAuth credentials to your deployment platform's environment variables or in your `.env` file in local

```bash [.env]
STUDIO_GITLAB_CLIENT_ID=<your_gitlab_application_id>
STUDIO_GITLAB_CLIENT_SECRET=<your_gitlab_secret>
```
::

::tip
That's it! Once deployed with the appropriate credentials set as environment variables. Studio will be accessible from your production instance. Just login on the `/_studio` (or on the route you've configured) to start editing.
::

## Advanced options

### Custom Redirect URL

By default, Studio uses your deployment URL as the OAuth redirect URL. If you need to customize it you can specify a custom redirect URL:

```bash [.env]
# Using GitHub provider
STUDIO_GITHUB_REDIRECT_URL=https://custom-domain.com

# Using GitLab provider
STUDIO_GITLAB_REDIRECT_URL=https://custom-domain.com
```

::callout
This is useful when you need to handle OAuth callbacks through a specific endpoint.
::

## Working with Staging/Preview Branches

By default, Studio commits changes to the branch specified in your configuration (typically `main`). However, you can configure Studio to work with a staging or preview branch instead.

This is useful when you want to review changes on a preview environment before merging to production. You can currently handle pull requests manually from GitHub, but automatic PR creation is included in our roadmap and will be implemented in a future release.

::prose-steps
### Configure

Update your `nuxt.config.ts` to target your staging branch.

  :::tip
  You can use environment variables to manage multiple branches for different environments.
  :::

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  studio: {
    repository: {
      owner: 'your-username',
      repo: 'your-repo',
      branch: PROCESS.ENV.STUDIO_BRANCH_NAME, // Target your staging branch instead of main
    }
  }
})
```

### Deploy

Configure your hosting platform to deploy the staging branch to a preview URL (e.g., `staging.yourdomain.com`).

### Create a Separate OAuth App (based on your Git provider)

Create a new OAuth App specifically for your staging environment and use your staging URL as callback URL.

### Set Environment Variables

Configure your staging deployment env varibales with the staging OAuth credentials.

```bash [.env.staging]
STUDIO_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=<your_staging_github_client_id>
STUDIO_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=<your_staging_github_client_secret>
STUDIO_GITHUB_BRANCH_NAME=<your_staging_branch_name>
```

### Access Studio on Staging

Navigate to `https://staging.yourdomain.com/_studio` to edit content. All commits will be pushed to your configured staging branch.

### Merging to Production

Once you're satisfied with changes on your staging branch, create a pull request from your staging branch to your main branch on GitHub to deploy to production.

  :::note
  **Pull Request Automation Coming Soon**
  
  :br
  
  Automatic pull request creation from Studio is planned for a future release. For now, you'll need to manually create PRs on GitHub to merge staging changes into your main branch.
