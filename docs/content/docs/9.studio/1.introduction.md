## The new Nuxt Studio module

## How does it differ from the standalone platform?

Originally offered as a hosted platform at [nuxt.studio](https://nuxt.studio), Studio has evolved into an open-source Nuxt module that you can deploy alongside your Nuxt Content website.

This means content editors can manage and update content directly in production, without needing local development tools or Git knowledge.

### Key differences

- ✅ **Self-hosted** — runs entirely on your own infrastructure
- ✅ **No external dependencies** — no APIs or third-party services required
- ✅ **Free and open-source** — released under the MIT license
- ✅ **Built-in integration** — works within your Nuxt app

::warning
The new Nuxt Studio module requires a server-side route for authentication.
While static generation remains supported, your site must be **deployed on a platform that supports server-side rendering (SSR)**.
