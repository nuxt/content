  title: Git Providers with Nuxt Studio
  description: Configure GitHub or GitLab as your Git provider to publish content changes directly to your repository.
---

Git providers handle the synchronization between Studio and your repository. They are responsible for **pushing content changes** (commits) to your Git repository when you publish from Studio.

::prose-note{to="/docs/studio/auth-providers"}
Git providers are distinct from **Auth providers**. Git providers determine where your repository is hosted and enable you to publish content changes, while Auth providers control how users authenticate and gain access to Studio.
::

## Supported Providers

Studio supports two Git providers for repository operations: GitHub and GitLab.

### GitHub

To use GitHub as your Git provider, configure your repository settings in `nuxt.config.ts`:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  studio: {
    repository: {
      provider: 'github',
      owner: 'your-username',
      repo: 'your-repo',
      branch: 'main' // Optional, defaults to 'main'
    }
  }
})
```

#### Creating a GitHub Personal Access Token

::warning
This section is required if you're using an [Auth provider](/docs/studio/auth-providers) that doesn't provide Git access (like Google OAuth or Custom Auth). In this case you'll need to create a Personal Access Token to publish your changes.
::

::prose-steps{level="4"}
#### Navigate to GitHub Token Settings

Go to [GitHub Settings → Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new) and create a new **Fine-grained Personal Access Token**.

#### Configure the GitHub Token

Fill in the required fields:

- **Token name**: Your app name
- **Resource owner**: The GitHub organization (or user) the repository belongs to
- **Repository access**: Select **Only select repositories** and choose your repository
- **Permissions**: Click **Add permission** and select **Contents** then update access to **Read and write**

#### Set GitHub Environment Variable

Add the token to your deployment platform's environment variables:

```bash [.env]
STUDIO_GITHUB_TOKEN=<your_github_personal_access_token>
```
::

### GitLab

To use GitLab as your Git provider, configure your repository settings in `nuxt.config.ts`:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  studio: {
    repository: {
      owner: 'your-username', // or group name
      repo: 'your-repo',
      branch: 'main' // Optional, defaults to 'main'
    }
  }
})
```

#### Creating a GitLab Personal Access Token

::warning
This section is required if you're using an [Auth provider](/docs/studio/auth-providers) that doesn't provide Git access (like Google OAuth or Custom Auth). In this case you'll need to create a Personal Access Token to publish your changes.
::

::prose-steps{level="4"}
#### Navigate to GitLab Token Settings

Go to **User Settings → Personal access tokens** (or your group/organization settings if applicable) on GitLab.

#### Configure the GitLab Token

Fill in the required fields:

- **Name**: Your app name
- **Expiration date**: Set according to your security policy (GitLab defaults to 365 days, and non-expiring tokens are not allowed on most instances). See [GitLab's guidance on expiry limits](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/profile/personal_access_tokens/).
- **Scopes**: `api` (required for reading/writing repository content) :warning[Copy the generated token immediately; you won't be able to see it again.]

#### Set GitLab Environment Variable

Add the token to your deployment platform's environment variables:

```bash [.env]
STUDIO_GITLAB_TOKEN=<your_gitlab_personal_access_token>
```
::

## Publication Requirements

To publish content changes to your repository, Studio needs a valid access token with write permissions. The token can come from two sources:

### OAuth-based Access (Automatic)

When using **GitHub OAuth** or **GitLab OAuth** as your [Auth provider](/docs/studio/auth-providers), the OAuth token obtained during authentication is automatically used for Git operations. No additional configuration is needed.

```bash [.env]
# GitHub OAuth - token is obtained automatically during login
STUDIO_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=<your_github_client_id>
STUDIO_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=<your_github_client_secret>

# Or GitLab OAuth - token is obtained automatically during login
STUDIO_GITLAB_APPLICATION_ID=<your_gitlab_application_id>
STUDIO_GITLAB_CLIENT_SECRET=<your_gitlab_secret>
```

### Personal Access Token (Manual)

When using **Google OAuth** or **Custom Auth** as your Auth provider, you must provide a Personal Access Token (PAT) with repository write permissions:

```bash [.env]
# For GitHub repositories
STUDIO_GITHUB_TOKEN=<your_github_personal_access_token>

# For GitLab repositories
STUDIO_GITLAB_TOKEN=<your_gitlab_personal_access_token>
```

::warning
The Personal Access Token must have write permissions to the repository. Without it, users authenticated via Google OAuth or Custom Auth won't be able to publish changes.
::

## Working with Branches

By default, Studio commits changes to the branch specified in your configuration (typically `main`). However, you can configure Studio to work with a staging or preview branch instead.

This is useful when you want to review changes on a preview environment before merging to production.

::prose-steps
### Configure Your Branch

Update your `nuxt.config.ts` to target your staging branch.

  :::tip
  You can use environment variables to manage multiple branches for different environments.
  :::

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  studio: {
    repository: {
      owner: 'your-username',
      repo: 'your-repo',
      branch: process.env.STUDIO_BRANCH_NAME || 'main'
    }
  }
})
```

### Deploy Your Staging Environment

Configure your hosting platform to deploy the staging branch to a preview URL (e.g., `staging.yourdomain.com`).

### Configure Auth Provider for Staging

Create a new OAuth App specifically for your staging environment with your staging URL as callback URL. See [Auth Providers](/docs/studio/auth-providers) for setup instructions.

### Set Environment Variables

Configure your staging deployment environment variables depending on the Git and Auth provider you are using.

### Access Studio on Staging

Navigate to `https://staging.yourdomain.com/_studio` to edit content. All commits will be pushed to your configured staging branch.

### Merging to Production

Once you're satisfied with changes on your staging branch, create a pull request from your staging branch to your main branch to deploy to production.

  :::note
  **Pull Request Automation Coming Soon**

  :br

  Automatic pull request creation from Studio is planned for a future release. For now, you'll need to manually create PRs to merge staging changes into your main branch.
