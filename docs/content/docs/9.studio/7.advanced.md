This page explains how Nuxt Studio keeps your content synchronized between the browser (your production site) and your Git prodiver repository.

::prose-note
This section is informational. Synchronization happens automatically after setup and requires no manual action.
::

## Architecture Overview

The self-hosted Nuxt Studio module uses a three-tier system for storage:

### Production Database (SQLite WASM)

When the application loads in the browser, Nuxt Content v3 downloads a SQLite database dump from the server and initializes a local WASM database. :br
This local database contains all content from the `content/` directory of your deployed branch.

::warning
This browser-side database stays in sync with your Git repository as long as your last deployment was built successfully and your CI/CD pipeline completed without errors.
::

### Draft Storage (IndexedDB)

Studio maintains a separate **draft layer** using [unstorage](https://unstorage.unjs.io/), backed by IndexedDB. :br
When you edit content, your changes are stored as *drafts* in this layer. :br
Each time the Studio app loads, these drafts are merged with the SQLite database to render a *drafted* version of your production site.

::note
Drafts are stored only in your local browser. They are not shared between editors or devices.
::

### Git Repository

When you publish, Studio commits your draft changes directly to your Git repository (GitHub or GitLab) through the provider's API. :br
Your CI/CD pipeline then rebuilds and redeploys your site automatically.

::warning
After deployment, you need to wait for your build to complete successfully, then refresh your site to update your browser database with your latest content.
::

::tip
The Studio module will automatically notify you when a new deployment is detected.
::

## How Synchronization Works

### Initial Load

::prose-steps{level="4"}
#### Database Initialization

Nuxt Content downloads the SQLite database dump generated during the build process. :br
This file contains all parsed content from your `content/` directory.

#### Draft Recovery

Studio checks IndexedDB for any existing drafts from previous sessions and loads them into the SQLite database.

#### Preview

Studio refreshes the site preview so you can view your latest drafts and edits directly on your production website.
::

### Editing Content

When you modify content in Studio:

::prose-steps{level="4"}
#### Draft Modification

Changes are saved immediately in IndexedDB as draft items with a status of `created`, `modified`, or `deleted`.

#### Database Update

The local SQLite database is updated to include your draft content, allowing instant visual preview.

#### Conflict Detection

Studio compares your draft content against the latest version in your Git repository to detect possible conflicts.

Conflicts can occur when:

- Someone pushes a commit that modifies the same file and its version is currently building.
- A deployment fails or hasn't completed, leaving the production database out of date and out of sync with your Git repository.
::

### Publishing Changes

When you publish your edits:

::prose-steps{level="4"}
#### Draft Collection

Studio gathers all draft items that contain changes.

#### Git Commit

Using your Git provider's API, Studio creates a new commit with all updated files.

#### Deployment Trigger

Your CI/CD platform detects the commit and automatically rebuilds and redeploys your website.

#### Deployment Wait

After publication, Studio clears the local drafts and waits for the deployment to complete. :br
During this time, a loading state is shown while the production SQLite database catches up with your latest commit.

  :::warning
  Until your commit is deployed, Studio remains in a pending state where the production database is not yet up to date.
