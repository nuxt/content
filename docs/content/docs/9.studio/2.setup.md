::note{to="https://nuxt.studio/docs/setup"}
This documentation covers only the new open-source Nuxt Studio module.
Click here to view the documentation for the legacy standalone platform.
::

## Install

Add the Nuxt Studio module to your project:

::code-group
```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add nuxt-studio@alpha
```

```bash [npm]
npm install nuxt-studio@alpha
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add nuxt-studio@alpha
```

```bash [bun]
bun add nuxt-studio@alpha
```
::

Alternatively, use the Nuxt CLI to automatically add the module:

```bash [Terminal]
npx nuxi module add nuxt-studio@alpha
```

## Configure

Add the module to your `nuxt.config.ts` and configure your GitHub repository:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: [
    '@nuxt/content',
    'nuxt-studio'
  ],
  
  studio: {
    // Studio admin route (default: '/_studio')
    route: '/_studio',
    
    // GitHub repository configuration (owner and repo are required)
    repository: {
      provider: 'github', // only GitHub is currently supported
      owner: 'your-username', // your GitHub username or organization
      repo: 'your-repo', // your repository name
      branch: 'main', // the branch to commit to (default: main)
      rootDir: '' // optional: if your Nuxt app is in a subdirectory (default: '')
    }
  }
})
```

::callout
If your Nuxt Content application is in a monorepo or subdirectory, specify the `rootDir` option to point to the correct location.
::

## GitHub OAuth App

Nuxt Studio uses GitHub OAuth for authentication.

::prose-steps

### Navigate to GitHub Developer Settings

Go to [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers) and click **New OAuth App**

### Configure the OAuth Application

Fill in the required fields:
- **Application name**: Your app name
- **Homepage URL**: `https://yourdomain.com`
- **Authorization callback URL**: `https://yourdomain.com`

:note[If you want to try studio locally, set the callback url to your local url `http://localhost:3000`]

### Copy Your Credentials

After creating the OAuth app, you'll receive:

- A **Client ID** (visible immediately)
- A **Client Secret** (click **Generate a new client secret**)

### Set your environment Variables

Add the GitHub OAuth credentials to your deployment platform's environment variables or in your `.env` file in local

```bash [.env]
STUDIO_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=<your_github_client_id>
STUDIO_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=<your_github_client_secret>
```
::

## Deployment

Nuxt Studio requires a server-side route for authentication.

While static generation remains supported with [Nuxt hybrid rendering](https://nuxt.com/docs/4.x/guide/concepts/rendering#hybrid-rendering), your site must be **deployed on a platform that supports server-side rendering (SSR)** using `nuxt build` command.

If you want to pre-render all your pages, use the following configuration:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  nitro: {
    prerender: {
      // Pre-render the homepage
      routes: ['/'],
      // Then crawl all the links on the page
      crawlLinks: true
    }
  }
})
```

## Working with Staging/Preview Branches

By default, Studio commits changes to the branch specified in your configuration (typically `main`). However, you can configure Studio to work with a staging or preview branch instead.

This is useful when you want to review changes on a preview environment before merging to production. You can currently handle pull requests manually from GitHub, but automatic PR creation is included in our roadmap and will be implemented in a future release.

::prose-steps
### Configure

Update your `nuxt.config.ts` to target your staging branch.

  :::tip
  You can use environment variables to manage multiple branches for different environments.
  :::

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  studio: {
    repository: {
      owner: 'your-username',
      repo: 'your-repo',
      branch: PROCESS.ENV.STUDIO_GITHUB_BRANCH_NAME, // Target your staging branch instead of main
    }
  }
})
```

### Deploy

Configure your hosting platform to deploy the staging branch to a preview URL (e.g., `staging.yourdomain.com`).

### Create a Separate GitHub OAuth App

Create a new OAuth App specifically for your staging environment:

- **Application name**: Your App Name (Staging)
- **Homepage URL**: `https://staging.yourdomain.com`
- **Authorization callback URL**: `https://staging.yourdomain.com`

### Set Environment Variables

Configure your staging deployment with the staging OAuth credentials and your br

```bash [.env.staging]
STUDIO_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=<your_staging_github_client_id>
STUDIO_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=<your_staging_github_client_secret>
STUDIO_GITHUB_BRANCH_NAME=<your_staging_branch_name>
```

### Access Studio on Staging

Navigate to `https://staging.yourdomain.com/_studio` to edit content. All commits will be pushed to your configured staging branch.

### Merging to Production

Once you're satisfied with changes on your staging branch, create a pull request from your staging branch to your main branch on GitHub to deploy to production.

  :::note
  **Pull Request Automation Coming Soon**
  
  :br
  
  Automatic pull request creation from Studio is planned for a future release. For now, you'll need to manually create PRs on GitHub to merge staging changes into your main branch.
  :::
::

### Accessing Studio

After deployment, access the Studio interface by navigating to your configured route (default: `/_studio`):

1. Click **Login with GitHub** if it does not directly redirect to the OAuth app authorization page
2. Authorize the OAuth application
3. You'll be redirected back to Studio, ready to edit your content

::note
Secure OAuth-based login with **Google** should be available quickly in the Beta release.
::

::tip
You can also use the shortcut :kbd{value="meta"} + :kbd{value="."} to redirect to the Studio route.
::

## Development mode

Nuxt Studio includes an **experimental** development mode that enables real-time file system synchronization:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  studio: {
    development: {
      sync: true // Enable development mode
    }
  }
})
```

When enabled, Nuxt Studio will:

- ✅ Write changes directly to your local `content/` directory
- ✅ Write media changes to your local `public/` directory
- ❌ Listen for file system changes and update the editor
- ❌ Commit changes to your repository (use your classical workflow instead)
