::note{to="https://nuxt.studio/docs/setup"}
This documentation covers only the new open-source Nuxt Studio module.
Click here to view the documentation for the legacy standalone platform.

## Install

Add the Nuxt Studio module to your project:

::code-group
```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add nuxt-studio@alpha
```

```bash [npm]
npm install nuxt-studio@alpha
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add nuxt-studio@alpha
```

```bash [bun]
bun add nuxt-studio@alpha
```
::

Alternatively, use the Nuxt CLI to automatically add the module:

```bash [Terminal]
npx nuxi module add nuxt-studio@alpha
```

## Configure

Add the module to your `nuxt.config.ts` and configure your repository based on your Git provider:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: [
    '@nuxt/content',
    'nuxt-studio'
  ],
  
  studio: {
    // Studio admin route (default: '/_studio')
    route: '/_studio',
    
    // Git repository configuration (owner and repo are required)
    repository: {
      provider: 'github', // 'github' or 'gitlab'
      owner: 'your-username', // your GitHub/GitLab username or organization
      repo: 'your-repo', // your repository name
      branch: 'main', // the branch to commit to (default: main)
    }
  }
})
```

### Options

#### Root directory `default: ''`

If your Nuxt Content application is in a monorepo or subdirectory, specify the `rootDir` option to point to the correct location.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  studio: {
    repository: {
      ...
      rootDir: 'docs'
    }
  }
})
```

#### Private Repository Access `default: true`

By default, Studio requests access to both public and private repositories.

Setting `private: false` limits the OAuth scope to public repositories only, which may be preferable for security or compliance reasons when working with public repositories.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  studio: {
    repository: {
      ...
      private: false
    }
  }
})
```

## Dev mode

🚀 That’s all you need to enable Studio in local.

Once your project is running locally, any file changes will be synchronized in real time with the file system.

::warning
The publish system is only available in production mode. You can use your classical workflow (IDE, CLI, GitHub Desktop...) to publish your changes in local.
::

## Production mode

While Nuxt Studio can be useful during development (especially with the upcoming Studio editor) its main advantage is the ability to publish changes directly from your production website.

### OAuth Configuration

To enable this Nuxt Studio supports authentication through both GitHub and GitLab OAuth providers allowing you to log in and publish updates from production.

::tip{icon="i-lucide-info" to="/docs/studio/github#oauth-providers"}
Choose your provider and follow the dedicated setup instructions for your Git provider in this section.
::

### Deployment

Nuxt Studio requires a server-side route for authentication.

While static generation remains supported with [Nuxt hybrid rendering](https://nuxt.com/docs/4.x/guide/concepts/rendering#hybrid-rendering), your site must be **deployed on a platform that supports server-side rendering (SSR)** using `nuxt build` command.

If you want to pre-render all your pages, use the following configuration:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  nitro: {
    prerender: {
      // Pre-render the homepage
      routes: ['/'],
      // Then crawl all the links on the page
      crawlLinks: true
    }
  }
})
```

### Accessing Studio

After deployment, access the Studio interface by navigating to your configured route (default: `/_studio`):

1. Click the login button if it does not directly redirect to the OAuth app authorization page
2. Authorize the OAuth application
3. You'll be redirected back to Studio ready to edit your content

::note
Secure OAuth-based login with **Google** should be available quickly in the Beta release.
::

::tip
You can also use the shortcut `CMD` + `K` to redirect to the Studio route.
