Nuxt Content provides several ways to import content files into your collection. You can configure the source by using the `source` property within `defineCollection`:

```ts [content.config.ts]
import { defineCollection } from '@nuxt/content'

export const collections = {
  docs: defineCollection({
    source: '**',
    type: 'page'
  })
}
```

## `source`

The `source` property can be defined as either a string (following a glob pattern) or an object, allowing more detailed source configuration for your target directory and files within the content folder.

**Example:**
- `source: '**` includes all files within the content directory and its subdirectories.
- `source: '**/*.md'`includes all `Markdown` files within the content directory and its subdirectories.
- `source: 'docs/**/*.yml'` includes all `YML` files within the `content/docs` and its subdirectories.
- `source: '**/*.{json,yml}'` includes `JSON` or `YML` file within the content directory and all its subdirectories.
- `source: '*.json'` includes only `JSON` files located directly within the content directory, excluding any subdirectories.

### `include`

Glob pattern of your target repository and files in the content folder.

### `exclude`

Glob patterns to exclude content from the import.

### `prefix`

This configuration only applied for **page** type with 1-to-1 relationship between content files and pages on your site.

It represents the path prefix (base URL) of the corresponding page on the website. 

### `cwd`

Root directory for content matching.

### `repository`

External source representing a remote git repository URL (e.g., https://github.com/nuxt/content)
