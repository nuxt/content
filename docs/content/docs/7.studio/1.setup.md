Studio can be considered as the Pro version of **Nuxt Content**. It's the visual CMS platform of Nuxt Content optimized for website based on it.

## Our credo

Most CMS solutions have to choose between being very customizable for developers or highly user friendly for content editors, with Studio we want to do both.

### Intuitive

Content editors can benefit from a user-friendly interface including, among other things, an editor similar to Notion to edit their website content.

### Customizable

Developers can customize the edition experience and provide tools to the editor who can focus on content without requiring any technical expertise.

## Authentication

The Studio admin is located on [studio.content.nuxt.com], from there you can either login with GitHub or with Google. Both methods give you the same edition rights but since Studio is [synchronized with GitHub](/docs/studio/github), some features are specific to GitHub users, especially project creation (synchronized with a GitHub repository).

Google authentication is adapted for non technical users. Google users have to join a team with existing projects to edit them.

## Create your project

Once you are logged in the admin, you have the possibility to create a project from the interface.

Two options are available, you can either start from an [existing repository](/docs/projects/create) or use one of our [templates](/docs/projects/create).

The only requirement at that point is to connect to our [GitHub app](/docs/studio/github), you'll be then able to link a GitHub repository to your project.

Once the project is created, you can start editing your files with the Studio editor and publish your changes.

## Enable the live preview

Once created, your project URL must be set to enjoy all Studio features, especially the live preview of your website.

::tip
We are proposing a GitHub Pages deployment. With it we will handle all the requirements for you. However, if you want to use the deployment platform of your choice, please follow the guidelines below.
::

To enable the live preview, you just need to activate studio in the content confiuration of `nuxt.config.ts` file.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  content: {
    studio: {
      enabled: true
    }
  }
})
```

Once deployed, you can ensure Studio has been activated by navigating to the `/__studio.json` page on your site. This metadata page is automatically generated by the Studio module and must be accessible to connect your URL in the self-hosted section of Nuxt Studio.

### Troubleshooting

The `__studio.json` file is generated but you encounter a `Forbidden error: invalid property check` when setting your URL in the self-hosted section, follow these steps:

1. Ensure the `gitInfo` field is set  and accurate in the `__studio.json` file:

```json [https://your-website.com/__studio.json]
"gitInfo": {
  "name": "studio-front",
  "owner": "nuxtlabs",
  "url": "https://github.com/nuxtlabs/studio-front"
},
```

::caution
This information should be populated automatically in most cases. We support most popular providers (Vercel, Netlify, etc.), but if you're using a non supported provider or a custom one, it may not be fetched correctly.
::

2. You can manually override this data by setting those configs in your `nuxt.config.ts`:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  content: {
    studio: {
      enabled: true,
      gitInfo: {
        name: 'Your repository name',
        owner: 'Your eepository owner/organization',
        url: 'Your GitHub repository URL'    
      }
    }
  }
})
```

3. By ensuring these fields are correctly set, you can resolve the `Forbidden error` and successfully enable your site preview on Nuxt Studio. If not, please contact us on the [Discord server]().
