## Browse your medias

All medias located in the `/public` directory are available in the **Media** tab of the Studio platform.

It's an intuitive interface for non technical users to manage their `/public` directory.

Users can easily browse folders, upload new media at any level, and drag and drop media into other folders, making medias organization straightforward.

The interface is designed to be intuitive for non-technical users. It can be viewed as a user friendly IDE.

## Use it in the Notion-like editor

Users can simply drag and drop images directly into the editor. An upload modal will open to let you choose the destination folder.

By typing `/` and searching for `Image`, they can quickly insert a media. A modal will open to let them choose the media they want to insert.

From the media modal, you can set the [alt attribute](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_img_alt.asp) for SEO and accessibility purpose.
