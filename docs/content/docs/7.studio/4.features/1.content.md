Nuxt Studio aims to be highly customizable and intuitive. As a developer, you have the opportunity to customize the edition experience. Let's see how.

# Browsing files

All files defined in your [collections](/docs/collection/define) and located in the `/content` folder of your project are accessible in the **Content** tab of the Studio editor. Within this interface, you can reorder files (using drag and drop), create new files, rename, or delete existing ones.

# File edition

We're providing two different editors to edit your file content depending on your file format.

## Markdown file

For Markdown files,our Notion-like editor provides all the standard text editing features with built-in added enhancements for editing Markdown files with the [MDC syntax](files/markdown).

Hereâ€™s how you can leverage this syntax to allow non-technical users to edit and embed Vue components:

### Frontmatter

// TODO collection

### Embed Vue components

1. You can create Vue components and integrate them into Markdown. They just need to be located in the `/components/content` folder to be available.

2. Integrate these components easily within any Markdown file using MDC syntax.

3. Edit them with our Studio editors

The visual editor simplifies the component edition, allowing you to integrate and edit them directly in the visual editor. Non technical users can play with **slots** and **props** without any technical knowledge.

All components in the `/components/content` folder are available in the editor. Studio users can type `/` anywhere while editing to access the list of available components.

The visual editor is directly transforming your content back to **Markdown**. Check this blog post to understand how it works under the hood.

Just like the frontmatter, you can define the schema of those file using the define colleciton. We are then generatiing correspondign form.
