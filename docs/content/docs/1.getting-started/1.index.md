description: The powerful Git-based CMS designed specifically for Nuxt developers.

Welcome to Nuxt Content v3, a major upgrade that brings enhanced performance and innovative features to your Nuxt projects. This latest iteration of our Git-based CMS is optimized for modern application development.

## What's New?

### Content Collections

Collections organize related items within your project, helping you manage large datasets more efficiently. Key benefits include:

- **Structured Data**: Configure database architecture and define collections in [`content.config.ts`](/docs/collections/collections#defining-collections)
- **Type-safe Queries**: Direct TypeScript integration across all utilities
- **Automatic Validation**: Ensure data consistency across frontmatter fields and data files (json, yml...)
- **Advanced Query Builder**: Filter, sort, and paginate your collections with ease
- **Studio Integration**: Enhanced form generation and optimal editing experience through [Studio](https://nuxt.studio)

Learn more about [Content Collections](/docs/collections/collections).

### Improved Performance

A significant challenge in v2 was the large bundle size needed for storing files, particularly affecting serverless deployments.

V3 addresses this by transitioning to SQL-based storage in production. This switch requires zero configuration, supporting development mode, static generation, server hosting, serverless and edge deployments.

Benefits include:

- **Optimized Queries**: SQL storage enables ultra-fast data retrieval
- **Universal Compatibility**: Our adapter-based system integrates SQL databases across all deployment modes ([server](/docs/deploy/server), [serverless](/docs/deploy/serverless) and [static](/docs/deploy/static)). We welcome community contributions for additional adapters.

### TypeScript Integration

The new collections system provides automatic TypeScript types for all your data. Every utility and API is strongly typed based on your collection definitions, ensuring robust type safety throughout development.

### Nuxt Studio Integration :badge[Soon]{color=neutral}

[Nuxt Studio](/docs/studio/setup) and v3 are designed to complement each other perfectly.. The [studio module](https://github.com/nuxtlabs/studio-module) is now integrated directly into Nuxt Content, creating an ideal environment where developers can focus on code while team members manage content through an intuitive interface.

We're excited for you to explore these new capabilities. Dive into our documentation to learn more about integrating the module and implementing best practices in your next project.
