description: How to migrate from v2 to v3
---

Nuxt Content v3 has been rebuilt from the ground up, resulting in a new library with enhanced capabilities. While we've redesigned concepts and components in a similar way as Content v2, breaking changes are inevitable.

Don't worry, you don't need to modify your content files. We made sure that Content v3 handles content in the same way as Content v2.

## Changes

### Query/Find Contents

- `queryContent()` API is replaced with new `queryCollection()`
  - New API is backed by SQL
  - New API searches contents within a specific collection
- `fetchContentNavigation()` API is replaced with new `queryCollectionNavigation()`
- Surroundings now has its own separate API `queryCollectionItemSurroundings()`
- Document driven mode is fully dropped, meaning:
  - Markdown files will not convert to Nuxt pages automatically, you need to create pages, see [how](/docs/components/content-renderer#example)
  - `useContent()` composable is removed
- `searchContent()` is dropped in favor of new API `queryCollectionSearchSections`
  - Full text search can easily be done using this API See [Full-Text Search Snippets](/docs/advanced/fulltext-search)

### Rendering Components

- All content should be rendered using `<ContentRenderer>` component. `<ContentDoc>`, `<ContentList>`, `<ContentNavigation>` and `<ContentQuery>` components are dropped in v3.
- `<ContentSlot>` and `<MDCSlot>` components are not supported in v3. Instead components can simply use Vue's native `<slot>` component.
  - One of the main reasons for existence of `<ContentSlot>` and `<MDCSlot>` was to manipulate content before rendering and removing wrapping paragraphs from slot content. This unwrapping behavior is now supported via `mdc-unwrap` attribute in `<slot>` component. example: `<slot mdc-unwrap="p" />`
- We consolidated the `ProsePre`, `ProseCode`, and `ProseCodeInline` components
  - `ProseCodeInline` is now `ProseCode`
  - `ProseCode` is now `ProsePre`

### General Changes

- `_dir.yml` files are renamed to `.navigation.yml`
- There is no source option in module options, instead you can define multiple sources for your collections in `content.config.ts`.
- Document `._path` is now renamed to `.path`, likewise all internal fields with `_` prefix are removed or renamed.
- `useContentHelpers()` is removed

## Implement Document Driven mode in v3

Implementing document driven mode is Content v3 is quite easy. All you need is to create a catch-all page in Nuxt and fetch contents based on route path.

```vue [pages/[...slug\\].vue]
<script lang="ts" setup>
const route = useRoute()
const { data: page } = await useAsyncData(route.path, () => {
  return queryCollection('content').path(route.path).first()
})
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <header><!-- ... --></header>

    <ContentRenderer v-if="page" :value="page" />

    <footer><!-- ... --></footer>
  </div>
</template>
```

## Converting `queryContent` to `queryCollections`

As we mentioned above, `queryContent` is dropped in favor of new collection based `queryCollection`. There are two main differences between these two:

1. `queryCollection` is building a query for an SQL database.
2. `queryCollection` does the search only inside the specified collection. You should know the collection's name (key on config).

```ts [Find content with path]
// Content v2
const v2Query = await queryContent(route.path).findOne()
// Content v3 - don't forget to create `content` collection in `content.config.ts`
const v3Query = await queryCollection('content').path(route.path).first()
```

```ts [Find contents with custom filter]
// Content v2
const v2Query = await queryContent()
  .where({ path: /^\/hello\/.*/ })
  .find()
// Content v3 - don't forget to create `content` collection in `content.config.ts`
const v3Query = await queryCollection('content')
  .where('path', 'LIKE', '/hello%')
  .first()
```

## Convert `queryContent().findSurround()`

Surround now has its own separate API.

```ts
const targetPath = '/docs'

// Content v2
const v2Surround = await queryContent(targetPath)
  .only(['title', 'description', 'navigation'])
  .findSurround(withoutTrailingSlash(route.path))

// Content v3 - don't forget to create `content` collection in `content.config.ts`
const v3Surround = await queryCollectionItemSurroundings(
  'content', 
  targetPath,
  {
    fields: ['title', 'description', 'navigation']
  }
)
```

## Consolidate `ProsePre`, `ProseCode`, and `ProseCodeInline` components

Many `ProsePre` components are thin wrappers around the `ProseCode` component. We've consolidated these three components into two components. There is now no difference between `ProsePre` and multi-line code blocks.

1. MDC will now map and parse single backticks ``` as `ProseCode` instead of `ProseCodeInline`.
2. Block code examples (starting with three backticks) will now be mapped to the `ProsePre` component.

Suggested Changes
1. Your _current_ `ProseCode` logic should be moved to `ProsePre`
2. Rename your `ProseCodeInline` component to `ProseCode`
