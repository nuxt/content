Transformers in Nuxt Content allow you to programmatically parse, modify, or analyze your content files as they are processed. They are especially useful for:

- Adding or modifying fields (e.g., appending to the title, generating slugs)
- Extracting metadata (e.g., listing used components)
- Enriching content with computed data
- Supporting new content types

## Defining a Transformer

You can define a transformer using the `defineTransformer` helper from `@nuxt/content`:

```ts [~~/transformers/title-suffix.ts]
import { defineTransformer } from '@nuxt/content'

export default defineTransformer({
  name: 'title-suffix',
  extensions: ['.md'], // File extensions to apply this transformer to
  transform(file) {
    // Modify the file object as needed
    return {
      ...file,
      title: file.title + ' (suffix)',
    }
  },
})
```

### Transformer Options

- `name` (string): A unique name for your transformer.
- `extensions` (string[]): File extensions this transformer should apply to (e.g., `['.md']`).
- `transform` (function): The function that receives the file object and returns the modified file.

## Registering Transformers

Transformers are registered in your `nuxt.config.ts`:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  content: {
    build: {
      transformers: [
        '~~/transformers/title-suffix',
        '~~/transformers/my-custom-transformer',
      ],
    },
  },
})
```

## Example: Adding Metadata

Transformers can add a `__metadata` field to the file. This field is not stored in the database but can be used for runtime logic.

```ts [~~/transformers/component-metadata.ts]
import { defineTransformer } from '@nuxt/content'

export default defineTransformer({
  name: 'component-metadata',
  extensions: ['.md'],
  transform(file) {
    // Example: Detect if a custom component is used
    const usesMyComponent = file.body?.includes('<MyCustomComponent>')
    return {
      ...file,
      __metadata: {
        components: usesMyComponent ? ['MyCustomComponent'] : [],
      },
    }
  },
})
```

**Note:** The `__metadata` field is only available at runtime and is not persisted in the content database.


## API Reference

```ts
interface Transformer {
  name: string
  extensions: string[]
  transform: (file: ContentFile) => ContentFile
}
```

- `ContentFile` is the object representing the parsed content file, including frontmatter, body, and other fields.


## Supporting New File Formats with Transformers

Transformers are not limited to modifying existing contentâ€”they can also be used to add support for new file formats in Nuxt Content. By defining a transformer with a custom `parse` method, you can instruct Nuxt Content how to read and process files with new extensions, such as YAML.

### Example: YAML File Support

Suppose you want to support `.yml` and `.yaml` files in your content directory. You can create a transformer that parses YAML frontmatter and body, and registers it for those extensions:

```ts [~~/transformers/yaml.ts]
import { defineTransformer } from '@nuxt/content'

export default defineTransformer({
  name: 'Yaml',
  extensions: ['.yml', '.yaml'],
  parse: (file) => {
    const { id, body } = file
    
    // parse the body with your favorite yaml parser
    const parsed = parseYaml(body)

    return {
      ...parsed,
      id,
    }
  },
})
```


Register your YAML transformer in your Nuxt config just like any other transformer:

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  content: {
    build: {
      transformers: [
        '~~/transformers/yaml',
        // ...other transformers
      ],
    },
  },
})
```

This approach allows you to extend Nuxt Content to handle any custom file format you need.
