  description: Overview of our different Studio CMS editors to manage your content
    and your medias. Choose between our visual editors and our code editor.
---

Nuxt Studio offers a versatile workspace for both developers and content writers, giving them the freedom to choose between our differents editors:

- [Notion-like editor](#notion-like-editor-markdown-files) for `Markdown` files
- [Form editor](#form-editor-yaml-and-json-files) for `YAML` and `JSON` files
- [Code editor](#code-editor) for any kind of files (for technical users only)

::tip
You can choose your favorite editor from the settings page of your project.
::

Each editor serves its own purpose. Some users are used to code edition, while others prefer a non-technical, visual approach. At the end, **code syntax is the final output** for both editors.

## Notion-like editor (`Markdown` files)

![edit your website with a visual interface](/docs/studio/visual-markdown-editor.webp)

This editor is heavily inspired by Notion, well known for its intuitive design and flexibility. Much like a standard text editor, this editor is designed to be familiar and easy to use. However, it stands out with its additional features that improve the writing experience.

### Frontmatter

[Frontmatter](/docs/files/markdown#frontmatter) is a convention of Markdown-based CMS to provide meta-data to pages, like description or title or any other data you would like to store as `key: value` pair.

Based on the user [collection and schema](/docs/collections/define) provided, a form is generated to edit this metadata from the editor.

::prose-note{to="#form-editor-yaml-and-json-files"}
Check this section to learn more about form generation based on schema.
::

### Toolbar

Highlight your text to reveal the toolbar, giving you access to all the standard text editing features (title formatting, Bold, Italic, Strike-through, code, link, class, bullet list, numerated list...).

### Medias

Users can simply drag and drop images directly into the editor. An upload modal will open to let you choose the destination folder.

By typing `/` and searching for `Image` or `Video`, they can quickly insert a media. A modal will open to let them choose the media they want to insert from the media gallery (aka the`public` folder of the Nuxt application).

From the media modal, you can set the [alt attribute](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_img_alt.asp) for SEO and accessibility purpose.

### Vue Components

One of this editor standout features is its ability to integrate and customize any complex `Vue` component directly within the editor.

#### Create and integrate your own component

A developer can create any kind of visually complex components and editors will be able to use them and focus on the content. An editor can also play with the component properties, styles, and behaviour to fit its specific requirements as long as the developer made it customisable.

::steps{level="4"}
#### Create your component

You can create Vue components and integrate them into Markdown. They just need to be located in the `/components/content` folder to be available.

```vue [components/content/HomeFeature.vue]
<template>
  <div class="flex items-start gap-3">
    <div class="flex items-center justify-center border rounded-lg p-1.5">
      <UIcon :name="icon" />
    </div>
    <div class="flex flex-col">
      <h3 class="font-semibold">
        <ContentSlot name="title" />
      </h3>
      <span>
        <ContentSlot name="description" />
      </span>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
defineProps({
  icon: {
    type: String,
    default: 'i-ph-cursor-click',
  },
})
</script>
```

#### Integrate these components easily within any Markdown file using [MDC syntax](/docs/files/markdown#mdc-syntax)

```mdc [content/index.md]
::home-feature
  ---
  icon: i-mdi-vuejs
  ---
  #title
  Embedded Vue components
  #description
  Edit slots and props inside the Notion-like editor.
::
```

#### Edit them with our Studio editors

The visual editor simplifies the component edition, allowing you to integrate and edit them directly in the visual editor. Non technical users can play with **slots** and **props** without any technical knowledge.

:video{autoplay controls loop src="https://res.cloudinary.com/nuxt/video/upload/v1744126742/studio/finalpropscomps_usfabp.mp4"}

 

All components in the `/components/content` folder are available in the editor. Studio users can type `/` anywhere while editing to access the list of available components.

:tip[Take a look at this section to validate your `Vue` component integration in the editor in local development.]{to="/docs/studio/debug"}
::

#### Integrate built-in components from external libraries

By default, you can integrate any component inside a Markdown file and it should work and be editable from Studio but external components **won't be displayed in the components list in Studio and can't be integrated manually by a Studio editor**.

To list this component inside Studio and fetch all its metadata, you need to set it as global in your Nuxt config file.

Here is an example to integrate Button and Icon components from the [Nuxt UI](https://ui.nuxt.com) library:

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  hooks: {
    'components:extend': (components) => {
      const globals = components.filter(c => ['UButton', 'UIcon'].includes(c.pascalName))

      globals.forEach(c => c.global = true)
    }
  },
})
```

## Form editor

![YAML and JSON edition with auto generated form](/blog/frontmatters.png)

This editor is used whether you’re editing the [frontmatter]() of a `Markdown` file or a `JSON` / `YAML` file.

It eliminates the need to interact directly with complex file syntax. Instead, a form is automatically generated based on the provided user [collection schema](/docs/collections/define).

### **Defining your form with** `zod` Schema

::prose-note{to="/docs/collections/define"}
Learn more about schema collection definition in the dedicated section.
::

Once the `schema` property has been defined in your collection, this will automatically generate the corresponding form on Studio interface.

::prose-code-group
```ts [content.config.ts]
export default defineContentConfig({
  collections: {
    posts: defineCollection({
      type: 'page',
      source: 'blog/*.md',
      schema: z.object({
        draft: z.boolean().default(false),
        category: z.enum(['Alps', 'Himalaya', 'Pyrenees']).optional(),
        date: z.date(),
        image: z.object({
          src: z.string().editor({ input: 'media' }),
          alt: z.string(),
        }),
        slug: z.string().editor({ hidden: true }),
        icon: z.string().optional().editor({ input: 'icon' }),
        authors: z.array(z.object({
          slug: z.string(),
          username: z.string(),
          name: z.string(),
          to: z.string(),
          avatar: z.object({
            src: z.string(),
            alt: z.string(),
          }),
        })),
      }),
    }),
  },
})    
```

### **Native Inputs Mapping**

Primitive Zod types are automatically mapped to appropriate form inputs in:

- **String** → Text input
- **Date** → Date picker
- **Number** → Number input (counter)
- **Boolean** → Toggle switch
- **Enum** → Select dropdown
- **Arrays of strings** → List of badge inputs
- **Arrays of objects** → Accordion of items with embedded form

:video{autoplay controls loop poster="https://res.cloudinary.com/nuxt/video/upload/v1740679550/arrayobjectandstring_r1jpvz.jpg" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/nuxt/video/upload/v1740679550/arrayobjectandstring_r1jpvz.mp4"}

### Custom Inputs Mapping

Studio goes beyond primitive types. You can customise form fields using the `editor` method, which extends Zod types with metadata to empower editor interface.

This allows you to define custom inputs or hide fields.

#### Usage

```ts [content.config.ts]
mainScreen: z.string().editor({ input: 'media' })
```

#### Options

##### `input: 'media' | 'icon'`

You can set the editor input type. Currently `icon` and `media` are available.

##### `hidden: Boolean`

This option can be set to avoid the display of a field in the Studio editor.

::prose-tip
Studio inputs are fully extensible. We can create as many input as we want based on our users needs.

## Code editor

![Edit directly your raw content with our code editor](/docs/studio/code-editor.webp)

Even though the two previous editors are dedicated to a specific file extension (`md` or `yaml`/`json`). The code editor can be used with any kind of file.

It provides full control over your content, allowing you to write raw content directly:

- [MDC](/docs/files/markdown) syntax for `Markdown` files
- [JSON](/docs/files/json) or [YAML](/docs/files/yaml) syntax

When your file is saved with the code editor, the content is stored exactly as you've written it, preserving all specific syntax and formatting. This editor is ideal for users comfortable with code syntax (`Markdown`, `YAML` or `JSON`) who want precise control over structure of their content.
