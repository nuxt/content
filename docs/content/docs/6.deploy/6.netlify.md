:hr

Nuxt Content projects can be deployed to Netlify with zero configuration. The module will automatically detects Netlify environment and prepare the necessary configuration for Netlify.

All you need to do is to go to Netlify dashboard and create a new project using git repository.

::note
By default Netlify uses Node.js 18.x which is not supported by the module. You need tochange the Node.js version in `Site Configuration` under `Dependency management`.
::

That's it :tada:

::note
By default module will use SQlite database in Netlify located at `/tmp` directory. You can override the database configuration by providing your own database configuration.
:br
There are many database providers that are supported by Netlify. You can use any of them by providing the correct connection string in `nuxt.config.ts`.
