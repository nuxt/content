description: Deploy your Content app with Docker
---

Docker is a popular containerization platform that allows you to package your application with all its dependencies into a single container. This makes it easy to deploy your Content app on any platform that supports Docker.

## With Node.js image

Using Docker's Node.js image, you can deploy your Content app. All you need is to create a Dockerfile and build the image. Here is an example Dockerfile:

```docker [Dockerfile]
# Build Stage 1

FROM node:22-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app

RUN corepack enable

# Copy package.json and your lockfile, here we add pnpm-lock.yaml for illustration
COPY package.json pnpm-lock.yaml .npmrc ./

# Install dependencies
RUN pnpm i

# Copy the entire project
COPY . ./

# Build the project
RUN pnpm run build

# Build Stage 2

FROM node:22-alpine
WORKDIR /app

# Only `.output` folder is needed from the build stage
COPY --from=build /app/.output/ ./

# Change the port and host
ENV PORT=80
ENV HOST=0.0.0.0

EXPOSE 80

CMD ["node", "/app/server/index.mjs"]
```

## With Bun image

If you like to use Bun, you can use the official Bun image. Here is an example Dockerfile:

```docker [Dockerfile]
# use the official Bun image
# see all versions at https://hub.docker.com/r/oven/bun/tags
FROM oven/bun:1 AS build
WORKDIR /app

COPY package.json bun.lock* ./

# use ignore-scripts to avoid building node modules like better-sqlite3
RUN bun install --frozen-lockfile --ignore-scripts

# Copy the entire project
COPY . .

RUN bun --bun run build

# copy production dependencies and source code into final image
FROM oven/bun:1 AS production
WORKDIR /app

# Only `.output` folder is needed from the build stage
COPY --from=build /app/.output /app

# run the app
EXPOSE 3000/tcp
ENTRYPOINT [ "bun", "--bun", "run", "/app/server/index.mjs" ]
```
