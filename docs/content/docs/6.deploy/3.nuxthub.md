Nuxt Content module has a built-in integration with [NuxtHub](https://hub.nuxt.com) to deploy your content.

To enable NuxtHub integration, you need to install the `@nuxthub/core` module and register it in your `nuxt.config.ts`. More efficiently, you can use `nuxi module` command to do both at once.

```bash [Terminal]
npx nuxi module add hub
```

That's it 🎉

::callout
Nuxt Content module automatically reads the NuxtHub database options in order to share the same database to store the Nuxt Content data.
