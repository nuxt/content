Quick Setup

- Execute `npx vercel deploy` command or go to Vercel dashboard and create a new project using git repository.

:hr

Nuxt Content projects can be deployed to Vercel with zero configuration. The module will automatically detect a Vercel environment and will prepare the necessary configuration for deployment.

All you need to do is to execute `npx vercel deploy` command or go to Vercel dashboard and create a new project using git repository.

That's it :tada:

::note
By default module will use SQlite database in Vercel located at `/tmp` directory. You can override the database configuration by providing your own database configuration.
:br
There are a couple of database providers that are supported by Vercel. You can use any of them by providing the correct connection string in `nuxt.config.ts`.
