Nuxt Content projects can be deployed to AWS Amplify with zero configuration.
The module will automatically detect an AWS Amplify environment and will prepare the necessary configuration for deployment.

## Option A: Use native `node:sqlite`

In order to use native `node:sqlite` package, you need to change node version to 22+. This can be easily done
in Amplify dashboard via `Build Settings` > `Live Package Updates` > `Package (Node.js version) = 22`.

This is also possible via `amplify.yml` inside `preBuild` phase.

```yml
frontend:
  phases:
    preBuild:
      commands:
        - nvm install 22
        - nvm use 22
        - node -v
        - npm ci
```

## Option B: Use `sqlite3`

All you need to do is to install `sqlite3` package in your project and go to AWS Amplify dashboard and create a new project using git repository.

That's it :tada:

::note
By default module will use SQlite database located at `/tmp` directory. You can override the database configuration by providing your own database configuration.
