# Announcing Nuxt Content v2

2 years after the [release of Content v1](https://github.com/nuxt/content/releases/tag/v1.0.0), we are proud to announce the second version of Nuxt Content built for [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com).

On top of the Nuxt 3 support, it comes with new features:

::list{icon="heroicons-outline:badge-check"}
- The [MDC Syntax](/guide/writing/mdc) for Components in Markdown
- Internationalization support
- [Navigation generation](/guide/displaying/navigation)
- [Fully typed](/guide/displaying/typescript)
- [Multiple sources](/api/configuration#sources) (experimental)
- Live preview edition (coming soon)
::

## What is Nuxt Content?

Nuxt Content is a [Nuxt module](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/concepts/modules) that reads Markdown, YAML, CSV and JSON files in the `content/` directory.

Let’s imagine a `content/` directory with the following structure:

::code-group
``` [Directory Structure]
content/
  index.md
```

```md [index.md]
# Hello World

My first paragraph.

https://content.nuxtjs.org
```
::

Create a `pages/[...slug].vue` file with the [`<ContentDoc>`](/guide/displaying/rendering) component inside:

```vue [pages/[...slug].vue]
<template>
  <ContentDoc />
</template>
```

And voilà!

::code-group
  ::code-block{label="Preview"}
  # Hello World

  My first paragraph.

  https://content.nuxtjs.org
  ::
::

You can also query the `hello.md` file by using the `queryContent()` composable:

```ts
const file = await queryContent('hello').findOne()
```

::callout
#summary
The returned file won't be Markdown or HTML, but a JSON representing the abstract syntax tree.

#content
```json [document value]
{
  "_type": "markdown",
  "_id": "content:hello.md",
  "_source": "content",
  "_file": "hello.md",
  "_extension": "md",
  "_path": "/hello",
  "_draft": false,
  "_partial": false,
  "_empty": false,
  "title": "Hello World",
  "description": "My first paragraph.",
  "body": {
    "type": "root",
    "children": [
      {
        "type": "element",
        "tag": "h1",
        "props": {
          "id": "hello-world"
        },
        "children": [
          {
            "type": "text",
            "value": "Hello World"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "type": "element",
        "tag": "p",
        "props": {},
        "children": [
          {
            "type": "text",
            "value": "My first paragraph."
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "type": "element",
        "tag": "p",
        "props": {},
        "children": [
          {
            "type": "element",
            "tag": "a",
            "props": {
              "href": "https://content.nuxtjs.org",
              "rel": [
                "nofollow",
                "noopener",
                "noreferrer"
              ],
              "target": "_blank"
            },
            "children": [
              {
                "type": "text",
                "value": "https://content.nuxtjs.org"
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "toc": {
      "title": "",
      "searchDepth": 2,
      "depth": 2,
      "links": []
    }
  }
}
```

You can do much more than fetching only one file. Take a look at the [querying content](/guide/displaying/querying) section to discover its full potential.

## Introducing MDC

We wanted to leverage the power of Vue components in a content edition experience. After months of testing on the [Nuxt website](https://nuxtjs.org), we are happy to introduce the [**M**ark**D**own **C**omponents syntax](/guide/writing/mdc).

::list{icon="heroicons-outline:badge-check"}
- Use your own Vue components in Markdown
- Customize them with props
- Write Markdown content in slots (and of course, you can nest them)
- Experience blazing fast HMR for Markdown and MDC (as fast as Vite!)
::

::alert{type="info"}
MDC is Markdown, so nothing changes and you can keep using the `.md` extension.
::

### Show me how it works!

::code-group
  ```md [content/index.md]
  ::my-button{type="success"}
  ✏️ Start **writing!**
  ::
  ```

  ```html [components/MyButton.vue]
  <script setup>
  defineProps({
    type: {
      type: String,
      default: 'info'
    }
  })
  </script>

  <template>
    <button :class="type">
      <ContentSlot :use="$slots.default" unwrap="p" />
    </button>
  </template>
  ```

  ::code-block{label="Preview" preview}
  <MyButton type="success">✏️ Start <strong>writing!</strong></MyButton>
  ::
::

Head over to the [MDC guide](/guide/writing/mdc) to discover the full power of Markdown with Vue components.

## An introduction video

Nuxt Content has many features, we built a video to showcase how to start using it in a Nuxt 3 application, in 3 minutes :sparkles:

:video-player{src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9e12WbKrd8"}

## Thank you

We are thankful for all the contributions we received in Content v1 and are impatient to see what you will build with Nuxt 3 and Content v2 :blush:

::alert{type="info"}
The repository is open source under the MIT license and available on GitHub: @nuxt/content

Head over to the [Get started](/get-started) section to start playing with Content v2 :sparkles:

Bonus: We created [Content Wind](https://github.com/Atinux/content-wind) - a lightweight Nuxt template to write a Markdown-driven website powered by Nuxt Content and TailwindCSS.

It is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Atinux/content-wind). Check out the demo on [content-wind.nuxt.dev](https://content-wind.nuxt.dev).
