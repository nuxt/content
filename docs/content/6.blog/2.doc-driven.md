2 years after the [release of Content v1](https://github.com/nuxt/content/releases/tag/v1.0.0), we are proud to announce the second version of Nuxt Content built for [Nuxt 3](https://v3.nuxtjs.org).

On top of the Nuxt 3 support, it comes with new features:

## What is Nuxt Content?

Nuxt Content is a [Nuxt module](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/features/modules) that reads Markdown, YAML, CSV and JSON files in the `content/` directory.

Let’s imagine a `content/` directory with the following structure:

::code-group
  ```[Directory Structure]
  content/
    index.md
  ```
  ```md [index.md]
  # Hello World

  My first paragraph.

  https://content.nuxtjs.org
  ```
::

Create a `pages/[...slug].vue` file with the [`<ContentDoc>`](/guide/displaying/rendering) component inside:

```vue [pages/[...slug].vue]
<template>
  <ContentDoc />
</template>
```

And voilà!

::code-group
  ::code-block{label="Preview" preview}
    # Hello World

    My first paragraph.

    https://content.nuxtjs.org
  ::
::

You can also query the `hello.md` file by using the `queryContent()` composable:

```ts
const file = await queryContent('hello').findOne()
```
