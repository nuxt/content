::template-core
Docus is a theme based on the [UI Pro documentation template](https://docs-template.nuxt.dev/). While the visual style comes ready out of the box, your focus should be on writing content using the Markdown and [MDC syntax](https://content.nuxt.com/docs/files/markdown#mdc-syntax) provided by [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxt.com).

We use this theme across all our Nuxt module documentations, including:

  :::card-group

    target: _blank
    title: Nuxt Image
