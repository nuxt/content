# Edge Channel

Nuxt Content is landing commits, improvements, and bug fixes every day. You can opt-in to test them earlier before the next release.

After each commit is merged into the `main` branch of [nuxt/content](https://github.com/nuxt/content) and **passing all tests**, we trigger an automated npm release using Github Actions publishing a `@nuxt/content-edge` package.

You can opt in to use this release channel and avoid waiting for the next release and helping the module by beta testing changes.

The build and publishing method and quality of edge releases are the same as stable ones. The only difference is that you should often check the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nuxt/content) for updates. There is a slight chance of regressions not being caught during the review process and by the automated tests. Therefore, we internally use this channel to double-check everything before each release.
