# Node Server

Use the [`nuxi build` command](https://v3.nuxtjs.org//api/commands/build) to build your application. The JS files will be generated in the `.output` directory.

```bash
npx nuxi build
```

Generated files are ready-to-run on Node environment.

```bash
node .output/server/index.mjs
```
