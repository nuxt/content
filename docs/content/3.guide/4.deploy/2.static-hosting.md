# Static Hosting

There are two ways to deploy a Content application to any static hosting services:

- Static site generation (SSG) prerenders every route of your application at build time. For every page, Nuxt uses a crawler to generate a corresponding HTML file.
- Using `ssr: false` and `service-worker` preset to produce a pure client-side output.


## Prerendering

Use the [`nuxi generate` command](https://v3.nuxtjs.org//api/commands/generate) to build your application. The HTML files will be generated in the `.output/public` directory.

```bash
npx nuxi generate
```

## Client-side only rendering

If you don't want to prerender your routes, another way of using static hosting is to set the `ssr` property to `false` and `nitro.preset` to `service-worker` in the `nuxt.config` file. The `nuxi build` command will then output an `index.html` entrypoint like a classic client-side Vue.js application.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts|js]
defineNuxtConfig({
  ssr: false,
  nitro: {
    preset: 'service-worker'
  }
})
```

Nuxt Content highly depends on [Nuxt's server engine](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/concepts/server-engine). The only way to have server engine in client-only rendering is to use Service Workers.
