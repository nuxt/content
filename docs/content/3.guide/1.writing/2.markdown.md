# Markdown

Nuxt Content uses the Markdown syntax and conventions to provide a rich-text editing experience.

- Use Markdown to format your content with Prose components.
- Edit the meta-data of your pages in the front-matter block of your files.

## Prose

In Nuxt Content, Prose represents the HTML tags generated by the Markdown syntax, such as title levels and links. A Vue component corresponds to each tag, allowing you to override them if needed.

::alert{type="info"}

### Example

::code-group
  ```markdown [Markdown]
  Just a paragraph.
  ```

  ```html [Output]
  <p>Just a paragraph.</p>
  ```

  ::code-block{label="Preview"}
  Just a paragraph.

### Customizing

If you want to customize a Prose component, here are the recommended steps:

- Checkout the original [component sources](https://github.com/nuxt-modules/mdc/blob/main/src/runtime/components/prose).
- Use the exact same props.
- In your `components/content/` directory, give it the same name.
- Make it yours 🚀.

## Front-matter

Front-matter is a convention of Markdown-based CMS to provide meta-data to pages, like description or title. In Nuxt Content, the front-matter uses the YAML syntax with `key: value` pairs.

These data are available when rendering the content and can hold any information that you would need.

### Syntax

You can declare a front-matter block at the top of the Markdown files in the `content/` directory with the `---` identifier.

```md [content/index.md]
---
title: 'Title of the page'
description: 'meta description of the page'
---

<!-- Content of the page -->
```

### Native parameters

| Key                                         |   Type    | Default                               | Description                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------- | :-------: | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `title`                                     | `string`  | First `<h1>`{lang="html"} of the page | Title of the page, will also be injected in metas                                                        |
| `description`                               | `string`  | First `<p>`{lang="html"} of the page  | Description of the page, will be shown below the title and injected into the metas                       |
| `draft`                                     | `boolean` | `false`                               | Mark the page as draft (and only display it in development mode).                                        |
| `navigation`                                | `boolean` | `true`                                | Define if the page is included in [`fetchContentNavigation`](/guide/displaying/navigation) return value. |
| [`head`](/api/composables/use-content-head) | `object`  | `true`                                | Easy access to [`useContentHead`](/api/composables/use-content-head)                                     |

When used together with [`<ContentDoc>`](/guide/displaying/rendering#contentdoc-) or the [document-driven mode](/guide/writing/document-driven) to display the current page, the [`useContentHead() composable`](/api/composables/use-content-head) will be used to set the page's metadata.

## Excerpt

Content excerpt or summary can be extracted from the content using `<!--more-->` as a divider.

```md
---
title: Introduction
---

Learn how to use @nuxt/content.
<!--more-->
Full amount of content beyond the more divider.
```

Description property will contain the excerpt content unless defined within the Front Matter props.

If there is no `<!--more-->` divider in the text then excerpt is undefined.

Example variables will be injected into the document:

```json
{
  "_id": "content:index.md"
  "excerpt": Object
  "body": Object
  // ... other keys
}
```

## Code Highlighting

Code highlighting allows you to display beautiful code blocks on your website.

Nuxt Content uses [Shiki](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki), that colors tokens with VSCode themes.

Code highlighting works both on [`ProseCode`](/api/components/prose#prosecode) and [`ProseCodeInline`](/api/components/prose#prosecodeinline).

Each line of a code block gets its line number in the `line` attribute so lines can be labeled or individually styled.

::alert{type="info"}
[Read the API reference to configure or entirely disable syntax highlighting.](/api/configuration#highlight)

## Images

You can add images to your `public` directory:

```
my-project/
  content/
    index.md
  public/
    img/
      image.png
  nuxt.config.ts
  package.json
  tsconfig.json
```

And then use them in your markdown files in the `content` directory as such:

```md[content/index.md]
![my image](/img/image.png)
```
