Document-driven development gives a lot more power to Markdown-based websites.

This mode creates a direct binding between the `content/` directory and pages.

It also offers `page`, `navigation`, `surround` and `globals` variables.

## Enable the mode

Add the `documentDriven` option in the `nuxt.config`:

```ts
import { defineNuxtConfig } from 'nuxt'

export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['@nuxt/content'],
  content: {
    documentDriven: true
  }
})
```

You can also use an object to configure the behavior of the mode, checkout the [configuration section](/api/configuration#documentdriven).

## Catch-all page

The document driven mode ships a pre-configured catch-all page.

This injected page is useful for having a minimal project structure:

```
my-project/
  content/
    index.md
  nuxt.config.ts
  package.json
  tsconfig.json
```

It comes with a direct binding between your pageâ€™s metadada to the OpenGraph tags using the [useContentHead() composable](/api/composables/use-content-head), providing effective SEO with no configuration.

### Page slots

That page comes with 2 slot components that you can replace at your project level.

To do so, you only have to create a component with the same name in your project `components/` directory.

- `<DocumentDrivenNotFound />`{lang=html}

```html [components/DocumentDrivenNotFound.vue]
<template>
  <h1>Page not found</h1>
</template>
```

- `<DocumentDrivenEmpty />`{lang=html}

This component will be shown when there is no content for the current page, but the page exists.

```html [components/DocumentDrivenEmpty.vue]
<template>
  <h1>This page is empty</h1>
</template>
```

This component will be shown when no page has been found for the current URL.

## Layout binding

As the page data is available beforehand, the layout can be defined in the page front-matter:

```md [content/blog/hello-world.md]
---
layout: article
---

This page will use the article layout!
```

By default, it uses the `default` layout if none is specified.

If you want to use another layout by default, use the `layoutFallbacks` option in the `nuxt.config`:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  content: {
    documentDriven: {
      layoutFallbacks: ['theme'],
    }
  }
})
```

This option will search for a `theme` key in `globals`, then search for a `layout` key inside that object. If found, that `layout` key will be used as a fallback.

## Global variables

Queries are be made from a [route middlewares](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/directory-structure/middleware#middleware-directory) and are resolved before your page renders.

This gives access to the [`useContent()`](/api/composables/use-document-driven) composable **anywhere in your app** with the following variables:
- `page`
- `surround`
- `navigation`
- `globals`

```html
<script setup lang="ts">
const { navigation, page, surround, globals } = useContent()

console.log(page.value)
</script>
```

## Extend global variables

This mode gives you a convenient way to access file data globally in your application.

Use the `documentDriven.globals` key of in your `nuxt.config` to specify a query:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  content: {
    documentDriven: {
      globals: {
        theme: {
          where: [
            {
              _id: 'content:_theme.yml'
            }
          ],
          without: ['_']
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

This configuration will search for a `_theme.yml` file in the `content/` directory.

If found, a `theme` object will be accessible via `useContent().globals`:

```ts
const { theme } = useContent().globals
```

Any changes to these files will be automatically reflected in the application during development.
