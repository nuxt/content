# Components usage

Content module allows you to use your custom Vue components inside markdown contents.

Components that are used in Markdown has to be marked as `global` in your Nuxt app.

## `components/content` directory

**@nuxt/content** provides a directory that will automatically mark your components as globals.

Every component created inside the `components/content` directory will be available in Markdown files.

- You can create any kind of component
- You can overwrite any existing components by following same naming
  - Creating `components/content/ProseA.vue` will overwrite any other existing `ProseA.vue` component injected from a module or any [extends](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/configuration/nuxt-config/#extends) layer.

All global components in your Nuxt app will be available to use in your markdown files.
