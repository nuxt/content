Navigation generation is based on your content sources directory structure.

Based on the generated `_id` and `_path` keys, we generate a whole navigation structure for your content.

It allows you to create advanced navigation components without having to maintain any querying logic related to it.

## Structure

The navigation object can be seen as a tree representing in a JSON format the structure of your content sources.

It is divided in two type of nodes, **pages** and **directories**.

::code-group

``` [Directory structure]
content/
  my-directory/
    page.md
```

```json [Directory node]
{
  "title": "My Directory",
  "_path": "/my-directory",
  "children": [
    ...pagesNodes
  ]
}
```

```json [Page node]
{
  "title": "Page title",
  "_path": "/my-directory/my-page",
  "_id": "content:my-directory:page.md"
}
```

```json [Complete navigation]
[
  {
    "title": "My Directory",
    "_path": "/my-directory",
    "children": [
      {
        "title": "Page title",
        "_path": "/my-directory/my-page",
        "_id": "content:my-directory:page.md"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

## Configuration

### Module

The only key available in [module configuration](/api/configuration#navigation) about navigation is `fields`.

`fields` allows you to define the properties that will be included in the navigation items.

::code-group

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
defineNuxtConfig({
  content: {
    navigation: {
      fields: ['author', 'publishedAt']
    }
  }
})
```

```md [page.md]
---
title: My Page
author: 'Sébastien Chopin'
publishedAt: '15-06-2022'
---
```

```json [Navigation node]
{
  "title": "My Page",
  "author": "Sébastien Chopin",
  "publishedAt": "15-06-2022",
  "_path": "/page",
  "_id": "content:page.md",
}
```

### Per-directory

Alternatively, the navigation also allows you to configure directory nodes via `_dir.yml` files.

It allows you to overwrite directory names, and add custom properties to directory nodes in navigation.

## Excluding

Set `navigation: false` in the [front-matter](/guide/writing/markdown) of a page to filter it out of navigation.

```md [page.md]
---
navigation: false
---
```

This pattern also works inside `_dir.yml` file, allowing you to filter out content directories and files.

```yaml [_dir.yml]
navigation: false
```

You can also use the `_` content prefix to exclude content directories and files.

::code-group

``` [Directory structure]
content/
  _hidden-directory/
    page.md
    index.md
  not-hidden-directory/
    _dir.yml
    index.md
    page.md
```

```json [Navigation object]
[
  {
    "title": "Not Hidden Directory",
    "_path": "/not-hidden-directory",
    "children": [
      {
        "title": "Page",
        "_id": "content:not-hidden-directory:page.md",
        "_path": "/not-hidden-directory/page"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

::


## Nested navigation

You can pass a `queryContent()`{lang="ts"} instance to the `fetchContentNavigation()`{lang="ts"} utility to filter the items returned.

That allows to create navigation objects for which the starting point is based on a specific content directory.

```ts
const query = queryContent({
  where: {
    _path: { $contains: '/your/navigation/starting/point' }
  }
})
```

::alert
Go deeper in the **API** section:

- [fetchContentNavigation()](/api/composables/fetch-content-navigation) composable to fetch navigation in `<script>`
- [ContentNavigation](/api/components/content-navigation) component made to shorten access to navigation in `<template>`
