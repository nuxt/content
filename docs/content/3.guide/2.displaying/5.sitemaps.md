A sitemap file is useful for helping Google to better index your website, ensuring that the content you write can be visible on search results.

This can be created utilising the `sitemap` library, so you'll need to install that which can be done like so:
  ```bash
  yarn add --dev sitemap
  ```

## Server Route
We will be utilising the server routes available within Nuxt 3, and to do so you'll need to create the `server/` folder within your websites root directly.

Once this is done, create a `routes/` folder inside this, and add a `sitemap.xml.ts` file, this corresponds to `https://example.com/sitemap.xml`.

You'll need to add the following:

```yaml [server/routes/sitemap.xml.ts]
import {serverQueryContent} from '#content/server';
import {SitemapStream, streamToPromise} from 'sitemap';

export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
    const articles = await serverQueryContent(event).find();

    const sitemap = new SitemapStream({ hostname: 'https://example.com' });
    articles.forEach((article) => sitemap.write({ url: article._path, changefreq: 'monthly' }));
    sitemap.end();

    let data = await streamToPromise(sitemap);
    return data;
});

```

Now, once users go to `https://example.com/sitemap.xml`, you'll find the generated XML file with all your blog posts.
