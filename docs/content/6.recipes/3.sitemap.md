# Library

This can be created by utilising the `sitemap` library, which can be installed as follows:

::code-group
```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add sitemap
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add sitemap
```

```bash [npm]
npm install sitemap
```
::

## Server Route

We will be utilising the [server routes](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/server#server-routes) available within Nuxt, and to do so you'll need to create the `server/` directory within your website's root directly.

Once this is done, create a `routes/` directory inside this, and add a `sitemap.xml.ts` file, this will translate to `/sitemap.xml`.

You'll need to add the following:

```ts [server/routes/sitemap.xml.ts]
import { serverQueryContent } from '#content/server'
import { SitemapStream, streamToPromise } from 'sitemap'

export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  // Fetch all documents
  const docs = await serverQueryContent(event).find()
  const sitemap = new SitemapStream({
    hostname: 'https://example.com'
  })

  for (const doc of docs) {
    sitemap.write({
      url: doc._path,
      changefreq: 'monthly'
    })
  }
  sitemap.end()

  return streamToPromise(sitemap)
})
```

Now, once users go to `https://example.com/sitemap.xml`, you'll find the generated XML file with all your pages.

When using `nuxt generate`, you may want to pre-render the sitemap since the server route won't be able to run on a static hosting.

You can do this using the `nitro.prerender` option in your `nuxt.config`:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  // ...
  nitro: {
    prerender: {
      routes: ['/sitemap.xml']
    }
  }
})
```
