The Grey Docs framework allows you to build beautiful documentation websites with Markdown and Vue components!

Grey Docs powers many of [Grey Software's Ecosystem Websites](https://org.grey.software/ecosystem/)!

This framework is built upon the [Nuxt content docs theme](https://content.nuxtjs.org/themes/docs/), and we are grateful
to the Nuxt team for open-sourcing their documentation framework!
