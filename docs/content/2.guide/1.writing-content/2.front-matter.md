# Front-matter

Front-matter is a convention of Markdown-based CMS to provide meta-data to pages, like description or title. In Nuxt Content, the front-matter uses the YAML syntax with `key: value` pairs.

These data are available when rendering the content and can hold any information that you would need.

## Syntax

You can declare a front-matter block at the top of the Markdown files in the `content/` directory with the `---` identifier.

```md[content/index.md]
---
title: 'Title of the page'
description: 'meta description of the page'
---

<!-- Content of the page -->
```

## Native parameters

| Key | Type | Description |
|---------|--------| -----|
| `title` | `String` | Title of the page (will also be injected in metas) |
| `description` | `String` | Description of the page, will be added below the title and injected into the metas |
| `draft` | `Boolean` | Mark the page as draft (and only display it in development mode). You can also use the filename suffix `.draft`, example: `3.my-draft-page.draft.md` |
