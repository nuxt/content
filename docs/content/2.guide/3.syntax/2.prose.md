# Prose

In Nuxt Content, Prose represents the HTML tags output from the Markdown syntax, for example title levels, links... A Vue component corresponds to each tag, allowing you to override them if needed.

::alert{type=info}

## Customizing

If you want to customize a Prose component, here are the recommended steps:

- Checkout the original [component sources](https://github.com/nuxt/content/tree/main/src/runtime/components/Prose).
- Use the exact same props.
- Name it the same in your `components/content/` directory.
- Make it yours üöÄ.
