# TypeScript usage

@nuxt/content v2 has been built with TypeScript in mind.

The module exposes typings properly from configuration to query builder.

## Usage

When using `queryContent()`{lang="ts"}, you will retrieve a [`QueryBuilder`](https://github.com/nuxt/content/blob/main/src/runtime/types.d.ts#L128) instance.

Once using one of the fetching methods (`find()`{lang="ts"}, `findOne()`{lang="ts"}, `findSurround()`{lang="ts"}), you'll retrieve an object of type [`ParsedContent`](https://github.com/nuxt/content/blob/main/src/runtime/types.d.ts#L128).

## Type augmentation

If you are adding keys to front-matter that are not in the "defaults" key, you might want to have typings over these.

This is currently possible, yet not in an _optimal_ way.

The currently recommended way to do it is by using this method:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import type { ParsedContent } from '@nuxt/content/dist/runtime/types'

interface MyCustomParsedContent {
  yourOwn: 'keys'
  foo: 'bar'
  baz: 'bar'
}

// That `data` key will be typed with `MyCustomParsedContent`
const { data } = await useAsyncData(
  () => queryContent<MyCustomParsedContent>({ ...anyQuery })
)
</script>
```

## The future

TypeScript support is a strong focus for us.

We want to provide fully generated type for each content in your project, that would allow the same as type augmentation.

This is not yet implemented but will be part of the roadmap in upcoming months.
