# Nuxt Content Usage

This page will guide you through the usage of Nuxt Content, from writing your content with MDC to displaying it.

## Create content

Nuxt Content reads the `content/` directory in your project, parses `.md`, `.yml`, `.csv` or `.json` files and creates a powerful data layer for your application.

``` [Directory structure]
content/
  blog/
    1.first-post.md
    2.second-post.md
  index.md
```

### Markdown

The Markdown files are parsed through [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs) and our [MDC parser](https://github.com/nuxt/content/tree/main/src/runtime/markdown-parser/remark-mdc) to leverage a syntax mixing both Markdown and Vue components.

```markdown [content/index.md]
---
title: 'Hello Content v2'
description: 'The favorite package of your favorite package'
---

# Hello Content!

The favorite package of your favorite package.
```

::alert{type="info"}
You can check the [Markdown basic syntax guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax) to help you master Markdown.
::

Configure your page data in the [Front-matter](/guide/writing-content/front-matter) block at the top of the file.


### YAML

### CSV

### JSON(5)



## Display the content

Anywhere in your Nuxt application, you can use the [`<Content>`](/api/components#content) component to render the content of a file matching the current route.

```vue [app.vue]
<template>
  <Content />
</template>
```



 file to query your content with the auto-imported `queryContent` composable. The `/` path corresponds to `content/index.md` (root of the directory).

## Use Vue components

Add and configure components in your Markdown pages thanks to the [MDC syntax](/guide/writing/mdc).

Create the `BlockHero` component and replace the content of `index.md`

::code-group

  ```html [components/BlockHero.vue]
  <script setup>
  defineProps({
    title: String
  })
  </script>

  <template>
    <section class="hero">
      <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
      <div class="hero__description">
        <slot />
      </div>
    </section>
  </template>
  ```

  ```markdown [content/index.md]
  ::block-hero{title="Hello Content!"}
  The favorite package of your favorite package.
  ::
  ```
