# Your first page

This page will guide you through your first Content page creation, from writing your content to displaying it.

## Start the dev server

Start the dev server and open a browser tab at <http://localhost:3000>

::code-group

```bash[yarn]
yarn dev
```

```bash[npm]
npm run dev
```

::

## Create a content file

Nuxt Content reads the `content/` directory to create content from `.md`, `.yml` or `.json` files.

Create the `index.md` file in the `content/` directory.

```zsh [Directory structure]
content/
  index.md
```

## Write Front-matter

Configure your page data in the [Front-matter](/guide/writing-content/front-matter) block at the top of the file.

```markdown [content/index.md]
---
title: 'Hello Content v2'
description: 'The favorite package of your favorite package'
---
```

## Add Markdown content

Use Markdown to write rich content below the front-matter block.

```markdown [content/index.md]
# Hello Content!

The favorite package of your favorite package.
```

## Display the content

Edit the `app.vue` file to query your content with the auto-imported `queryContent` composable. The `/` path corresponds to `content/index.md` (root of the directory).

```vue [app.vue]
<script setup>
const { data: document } = await useAsyncData('home', () => {
  return queryContent('/').findOne()
})
</script>

<template>
  <main>
    <Content v-if="document" :document="document" />
  </main>
</template>
```

The [`<Content>`](/api/components#content) component renders the content of the file in your browser.

## Use Vue components

Add and configure components in your Markdown pages thanks to the [MDC syntax](/guide/writing/mdc).

Create the `BlockHero` component and replace the content of `index.md`

::code-group

  ```html [components/BlockHero.vue]
  <script setup>
  defineProps({
    title: String
  })
  </script>

  <template>
    <section class="hero">
      <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
      <div class="hero__description">
        <slot />
      </div>
    </section>
  </template>
  ```

  ```markdown [content/index.md]
  ::block-hero{title="Hello Content!"}
  The favorite package of your favorite package.
  ::
  ```
