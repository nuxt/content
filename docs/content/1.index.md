#title
The Content Layer for your Nuxt Application

#description
Nuxt Content reads the `content/` directory in your project, parses `.md`, `.yml`, `.csv` or `.json` files and creates a powerful data layer for your application. Bonus, use Vue components in Markdown with the [MDC syntax](/guide/writing/mdc).
