Or open the [embedded playground](/playground).

## New Project

::callout
Before getting started, please **make sure to have installed the recommended setup**:
* Follow the [Nuxt 3 Prerequisites](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/installation#prerequisites)
* Download the [VS Code **MDC Extension**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Nuxt.mdc)
::

1. You can start a fresh Nuxt Content project with:

```bash [npx]
npx nuxi@latest init content-app -t content
```

It will ask you with which package manager you want to install the dependencies.

2. Move into the `content-app` folder and start the development server:

::code-group
```bash [pnpm]
pnpm run dev
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn dev
```

```bash [npm]
npm run dev
```

::callout
‚ú® Well done! A browser window should automatically open for http://localhost:3000

## Add to a project

You can add Nuxt Content at anytime during your Nuxt project development by installing the `@nuxt/content` module:

::code-group
```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @nuxt/content
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @nuxt/content
```

```bash [npm]
npm install @nuxt/content
```
::

Then, add `@nuxt/content` to the `modules` section of `nuxt.config.ts`:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: [
    '@nuxt/content'
  ],
  content: {
    // ... options
  }
})
```

## Create content

Place your markdown files inside the `content/` directory in the root directory of your project.

```md [content/index.md]
# Hello Content
```

The module automatically loads and parses them.

## Render pages

To render content pages, add a [catch-all route](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/pages#catch-all-route) using the `ContentDoc` component:

```vue [pages/[...slug\\].vue]
<template>
  <main>
    <ContentDoc />
  </main>
</template>
```

::callout{type="warning"}
‚ö†Ô∏è If you have an `app.vue` file at the project's root, ensure that you include [`<NuxtPage />`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/components/nuxt-page#nuxtpage) in its template to render pages.
::

::callout{type="warning"}
‚ö†Ô∏è Content v2 requires [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com). If you are using Nuxt 2, checkout [Content v1 documentation](/v1/getting-started/installation).
