::warning
This article was published before the merge of the [Content](https://github.com/nuxt/content) and [Studio](https://github.com/nuxtlabs/studio-module) modules on January 6, 2025. As a result, it may contain some inconsistencies. The Studio module is now deprecated and available as an opt-in feature of the Content module. Learn how to enable it in [this guide](/docs/getting-started).

## Auto-generated form for `YAML` and `JSON` files

:video{controls loop src="https://res.cloudinary.com/nuxt/video/upload/v1730132248/yml-json-form_n9czcs.mp4"}

Continuing our journey to make Nuxt Studio the tool for non-technical users to edit their content with Nuxt websites, we're excited to announce that `YAML` and `JSON` files can now be edited through a generated visual form. This update removes the need for users to interact directly with complex file syntax such as YAML or JSON.

Arrays are not yet handled as form but we'll work on it once collections and user-defined schemas will be released with Nuxt Content v3. See the section below.

### Synchronized navigation

Alongside this update, we’ve improved the synchronized navigation between the preview and selected files for non-Markdown formats (like YAML and JSON). To apply this fixe, please update the Studio module to the latest version `v2.2.0`.

## On the Road to Nuxt Content v3

We’re excited to share that the fourth alpha version of Nuxt Content v3 has been released, with the [**draft documentation**](https://content.nuxt.com/) available.

### What’s Next?

In the coming months, we’ll focus on testing and refining Nuxt Content v3 to ensure a robust, production-ready release. Here’s a quick look at the Nuxt Studio related improvements ahead:

- **Merging the Studio module**: Soon, the Studio module will be integrated directly into Nuxt Content. Once Nuxt Content v3 is released, activating Studio will be as simple as setting `content.editor: true` in your `nuxt.config.ts` file. This simplification means no extra module is required for Studio, making setup faster.
- **Unified documentation**: With the module integration, we’ll also merge the [Content](https://content.nuxt.com) and [Studio](https://nuxt.studio) documentation and websites into one comprehensive resource. Only the Studio platform (available once the user is logged) will remain as a standalone site.
- **Take advantage of data structures and collections in Studio**: With Nuxt Content v3, the Studio platform will support and adapt its behaviour to [collections](https://content.nuxt.com/getting-started/collections) and user-defined schemas. This enhancement will allow schema-generated forms for both YAML and JSON files as well as front-matter within Markdown files.

These updates reflect our commitment to providing the best content editing platform for your Nuxt website. Stay tuned!
