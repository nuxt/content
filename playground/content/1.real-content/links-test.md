## Introduction

This page tests that frontmatter metadata (including `links`) is correctly included in the raw markdown output.

Visit `/raw/real-content/links-test.md` to see the raw output with frontmatter.

## Content

Some example content to verify the body is still rendered correctly alongside the frontmatter.
