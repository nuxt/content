# Self-managed navigation

Nuxt Content provides a component and composable to display a navigation based on the `content/` directory structure and files.

Based on the generated `_id` and `_path` keys, Nuxt Content generates a whole navigation structure for your content.

It allows you to create advanced navigation components without having to maintain any querying logic related to it.

## Structure

The navigation object can be seen as a tree, representing the structure of your content sources in JSON format.

It is divided into two types of nodes: **pages** and **directories**.

::code-group
``` [Directory structure]
content/
  my-directory/
    page.md
```

```json [Directory node]
{
  "title": "My Directory",
  "_path": "/my-directory",
  "children": [
    ...pagesNodes
  ]
}
```

```json [Page node]
{
  "title": "Page title",
  "_path": "/my-directory/my-page",
  "_id": "content:my-directory:page.md"
}
```

```json [Complete navigation]
[
  {
    "title": "My Directory",
    "_path": "/my-directory",
    "children": [
      {
        "title": "Page title",
        "_path": "/my-directory/my-page",
        "_id": "content:my-directory:page.md"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```
::

## Custom keys

You can use the `navigation` property in the front-matter of your content files to add keys to the navigation object.

::code-group
```md [index.md]
---
navigation:
  title: 'Home'
  icon: '🏡'
---

# Welcome
```

```json [Navigation]
[
  {
    "title": "Home",
    "icon": "🏡",
    "_path": "/",
  }
]
```
::

Alternatively, the navigation also allows you to configure directory nodes via `_dir.yml` files.

It allows you to overwrite the `title` and custom properties to directory nodes in navigation.

::code-group
``` [Directory structure]
content/
  my-directory/
    _dir.yml
    page.md
```

```yaml [_dir.yml]
title: 'My awesome directory'
navigation.icon: '📁'
```

```json [Navigation]
{
  "title": "My awesome directory",
  "icon": "📁",
  "_path": "/my-directory",
  "children": [
    ...
  ]
}
```
::

If you want to use top-level keys in the front-matter to be included in the navigation object, use the [`content.navigation.fields`](/get-started/configuration#navigation) property in the `nuxt.config`:

::code-group
```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
defineNuxtConfig({
  content: {
    navigation: {
      fields: ['author', 'publishedAt']
    }
  }
})
```

```md [page.md]
---
title: My Page
author: 'Sébastien Chopin'
publishedAt: '15-06-2022'
---
```

```json [Navigation node]
{
  "title": "My Page",
  "author": "Sébastien Chopin",
  "publishedAt": "15-06-2022",
  "_path": "/page",
  "_id": "content:page.md",
}
```
::

## Excluding

Set `navigation: false` in the [front-matter](/usage/markdown) of a page to filter it out.

```md [page.md]
---
navigation: false
---
```

This pattern also works inside `_dir.yml` file, allowing you to filter out content directories and files.

```yaml [_dir.yml]
navigation: false
```

You can also use the `_` content prefix to exclude content directories and files.

::code-group
``` [Directory structure]
content/
  _hidden-directory/
    page.md
    index.md
  not-hidden-directory/
    _dir.yml
    index.md
    page.md
```

```json [Navigation object]
[
  {
    "title": "Not Hidden Directory",
    "_path": "/not-hidden-directory",
    "children": [
      {
        "title": "Page",
        "_id": "content:not-hidden-directory:page.md",
        "_path": "/not-hidden-directory/page"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```
::

## Nested navigation

You can pass a `queryContent()` instance to the `fetchContentNavigation()` utility to filter the items returned.

That allows to create navigation objects for which the starting point is based on a specific content directory.

```ts
const query = queryContent({
  where: {
    _path: { $contains: '/your/navigation/starting/point' }
  }
})
```

::callout{type="info"}
Go deeper in the **API** section:

- [`fetchContentNavigation()`](/composables/fetch-content-navigation) composable to fetch navigation in `<script>`
- [`<ContentNavigation>`](/components/content-navigation) component made to shorten access to navigation in `<template>`
