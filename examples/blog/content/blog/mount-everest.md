Mount Everest, the tallest mountain in the world, stands at an impressive 8,848.86 meters (29,031.7 feet) above sea level. Located in the Himalayas on the border between Nepal and the Tibet Autonomous Region of China, it is part of the greater Mahalangur Himal range. Everest attracts climbers from all over the world, including highly skilled mountaineers as well as capable climbers attempting to reach the summit with the help of professional guides. Despite its allure, Everest's extreme altitude, unpredictable weather, and challenging terrain make it a dangerous climb. Many people have lost their lives in pursuit of reaching the summit.

The mountain is known as "Sagarmatha" in Nepali and "Chomolungma" in Tibetan, both of which signify its cultural and spiritual importance to the local populations. Climbing Everest has evolved over the decades, with advances in technology and infrastructure making it somewhat more accessible. However, issues like overcrowding, environmental degradation, and the impact on the health of Sherpa communities who guide climbers have raised concerns. Despite these challenges, Mount Everest remains an iconic symbol of adventure and human endurance, continuing to captivate the imaginations of people worldwide.
